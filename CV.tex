Gauthier Patin was born in 1987 in Dunkerque, France. Having had an interest in art since his youth, he went on to study the conservation and restoration of works of art at the University of Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne (Master Conservation-Restoration des Biens Culturelles, specialising in the graphic arts, under the direction of Claude Laroque). Following his studies, he carried out several short-term contracts in the Netherlands and Germany, either as a researcher or as a paper conservator\footnote{A precise list of his past professional experiences can be found in resume available on his PhD website: \url{https://microfadingphd.wordpress.com/about-me/}.}. In 2018, he began a doctoral thesis at the University of Amsterdam on light-induced colour change in the context of Van Gogh's works. He currently works for the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands as a junior scientist.
