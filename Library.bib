This paper demonstrates the detection of invisible watermarked images generated by popular watermarking techniques, including CDMA, DCT, DWT, and Least Significant Bit (LSB) using quadtree. Results corresponding to typical (512 · 512) pixel images show differences among these methods when they are used. Each time we use the same image, the original images and invisible watermarked image to test the four methods in conjunction with quadtree decomposition. In addition to the subjective method represented by quadtree, many objective evaluations such as Pearson correlation, mean square error (MSE), Structural SIMilarity Index (SSIM) and false positive and false negative were used to give the comparison criteria between original and watermarked images. In results, the quadtree decomposition considered a promise subjective method to recognize among these watermark techniques.},

This method benefits from replacing the traditional visual evaluation of colour difference between exposed and unexposed areas of textile samples with a more accurate, instrument‐based measurement of the colour difference. The light fastness is then evaluated by comparing the colour difference with tabulated values of colour differences brought about by light exposure, for increased periods of time, of standard blue wool references. This method could be used for measuring light fastness of both traditional and photochromic fabrics. However, blue wool references and tested samples should be exposed to light under similar conditions when using this method to measure colour fastness to light of fabrics.},

	abstract = {Six commercial photochromic dyes were applied to polyester and, to a lesser extent, cotton fabrics by different dyeing and printing methods. The photochromic performance of the dyed and printed fabrics was investigated in terms of the degree of photocoloration, background colour, fading characteristics, fatigue resistance and storage stability. A traditional aqueous-based disperse dyeing method was used to apply the photochromic dyes to polyester fabric. Solvent-based dyeing methods also were investigated for application of the photochromic dyes to polyester fabric. Solvent-based inks were formulated and applied to polyester and cotton fabrics by digital inkjet printing. The photochromic performance and colour fastness to light and washing of the photochromic fabrics were evaluated and comparison made. UV/visible spectra of the commercial photochromic dyes in a range of solvents were obtained and interpreted in terms of solvent polarity. On the basis of this study, the photochromic performance of the fabrics was improved by selecting the appropriate application solvents which transferred minimum background colours onto the fabrics. A new method of evaluating lightfastness of photochromic fabrics was established, aimed at replacing the conventional method by an instrumental method. This method was based on comparing the decrease in the degree of photocoloration of photochromic fabrics after light exposure with measured values of the colour differences of the blue wool references after fixed periods of light exposure. Two photochromic dyes were synthesized by azo coupling of a spironaphtho[2,1-b]oxazine with diazonium salts obtained from p-nitroaniline, and m-nitroaniline. Molecular modeling of the new photochromic systems, which are referred to as azospirooxazine dyes, showed that the dyes were predicted to have the potential to show photochromism. Thus, the photochromism of the azospirooxazine dyes in a range of solvents was investigated. The investigations showed that the dyes performed differently in different solvents in terms of the hue, the rate of the photochromic colour change and the colour reversibility.},

	title = {Photofading and light stability of dyed and pigmented polymers},
	volume = {44},
	abstract = {The photofading and photostability of dyed and pigmented polymers is a commercial problem involving a complex interplay of phenomena and mechanisms many of which remain unresolved. Dye fading, for example, involves reactions not only associated with the dye itself but also those involving the polymer as well as dye-polymer interactions and these, in turn, are further complicated by the nature of the environmental conditions. All these processes are described for a series of azo, anthraquinoid and triphenylmethane based chromophoric systems. Thus, in the case of dye structure the nature of the substituent, i.e. electron withdrawing or electron accepting group, will influence its photophysical and photochemical behaviour as will the position of substitution on the chromophore. In the latter case intramolecular hydrogen bonding is significant for anthraquinone chromophores. The interaction of the photoexcited dye chromophore with the polymer matrix is an additional process which will not only control the stability of the dye but that of the polymer as well. In a number of cases the dye may sensitise the photochemical breakdown of the polymer, a process often termed 'phototendering'. This is more dominant in reductive polymer environments such as the nylons. Here, the complex role of reduction and oxidation reactions involving hydrogen (electron) abstraction and singlet oxygen reactions remain unresolved. In many cases these mechanisms are relevant to the photofading of dyes. The interactions of the dye and polymer matrix may also involve energy transfer and quenching with photoactive units or impurities giving rise to phototendering and/or stabilisation effects. The state of agggregation and concentration of the dye are also important parameters which are interrelated in controlling dye stability with the former being controlled by the nature of the polymer matrix. Pigments also play a major role in controlling the stability of a polymer matrix as well as that of a dye. In this regard titanium dioxide is important as a delustrant in textile fibres as well as its use in thermoplastic articles. In addition to these processes the stability of dyed and pigmented polymers is controlled by the nature of the atmosphere, e.g. presence of oxygen, the humidity which can often accentuate fading and degradation reactions, the light source and the temperature of the irradiation conditions. Many industrial developments in the dye and pigment worlds are hindered by such problems although some solutions are feasible in terms of effective stabilisation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a line of research aimed at studying in detail the interaction between air conditioning/heating systems and thermo hygrometric conditions inside museums. An experimental test was carried out on the microclimatic conditions inside a building envelope, using as case studies the interiors of the Castle of Chiaramonte in Favara (Agrigento), and the Church of Saint Matthew (Palermo). In this phase of the work the “real” measured values and the recommended “optimal” values were compared for the various museum exhibits displayed. The analysis of the complex dynamic interaction of climate conditions, the need for the museum pieces to be preserved in a situation of maximum stability, the problems regarding thermal comfort in relation to users’ enjoyment of the exhibition space, the construction model of the building envelope – the synergy between all these variables led to establishing the final design project. This consists of an air conditioning system with radiant panels, floor heating, cooling system and primary air, in which the benefits seen from an environmental and energy point of view, are fully explained. The conservation of cultural heritage collections in museums, on the one hand implies that the attention of the specialists must turn to the prevention of the natural degradation caused through time and on the other to improve the quality of the environment. This means environmental parameters must be checked and monitoring techniques used. Since the connective tissue between the museum and its container is the environment, the building-plant system must be held responsible for the “degradation suffered by the museum itself” or “be largely responsible for its optimal conservation with the passing of time”.},

	volume = {141},
	doi = {10.1016/j.microc.2018.05.005},
	abstract = {An important problem encountered during the preservation of paintings and other artworks is the fading of the original colors due to exposure of the colorants to light. This fact is clearly evidenced in some of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings in which an organic red, eosin or geranium lake, is present. The identification of eosin and the characterization of its degradation products in paintings represents a challenge because of (i) the generally low concentration of the pigment remaining after an aging period of ca 100 years, (ii) the scarcity of the paint micro samples available for analysis and the difficulty of obtaining additional ones and (iii) the complexity of the degradation behavior of eosin when it is mixed with organic or inorganic pigments, binding media or varnish. This study presents an accelerated aging experiment of eosin paint models in order to understand better the discoloration process; more specifically the influence of different metals with which eosin forms complexes and of the presence of admixture pigments such as lead white and cobalt blue on the lightfastness of eosin is evaluated. Paint model samples were prepared using eosin, lead white, and cobalt blue in different mixing ratios and were characterized with several techniques before and after aging. The possible formation of intermediate molecular forms during the aging experiment and the influence of pigment ratios on the discoloration process were monitored at periodic intervals using a combination of UV–Visible and attenuated total Reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopies. Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) and optical microscopy (OM) analyses were performed to gain information about the discoloration processes taking place within the paint models. Eosin precipitated on lead, aluminum and potassium/aluminum salts was used. These three lakes showed similar discoloration rates under light exposure. In contrast, the presence and relative abundance of the ad-mixture pigments lead white and cobalt blue had a significant influence on the (speed of the) eosin discoloration process. The presence of lead white and cobalt blue appears to stimulate the eosin degradation. However, the cobalt blue shows less influence in the discoloration process, showing a protective effect during the first stages of the aging. This may be qualitatively explained in terms of the ability of lead white to scatter light towards eosin molecules and the absorption characteristics of cobalt blue in the green range of the electromagnetic spectrum, shielding eosin from incoming light. The color changes observed in the paint reconstructions are similar to discoloration phenomena visible in some Van Gogh paintings and can offer an explanation of the gradual discoloration process that took place over the years. These insights will be helpful to estimate the original hues color used/intended by the artist.},

	abstract = {Lakes based on Eosin-Y are extensively used by 19th century artists. Unfortunately, the identification of these pigments in paintings is a difficult task because Eosin-Y degrades very fast under the influence of light. The characterization of the (photo)degradation products of Eosin-Y can be very useful for the identification of these pigments in historic works of art and related cultural heritage artifacts. Furthermore, knowledge on how different factors influence the discoloration process (e.g. different types of irradiation sources and presence/absence of oxygen) is a valuable tool for preventive conservation. To this aim we performed a study on the photodegradation of Eosin-Y in solution under different illumination and in both oxic and anoxic conditions. The photodegradation of Eosin-Y was monitored by UV-VIS spectrophotometry, LC-QTOFMS and electrochemistry techniques. Results indicated higher degradation rates, by a factor of 20 or higher, under illumination with wavelengths near to the main absorbance band of the red pigment. Two different degradation pathways are observed under the conditions studied. LC-QTOFMS and electrochemistry suggested that in the presence of oxygen the degradation mechanism is an oxidative process where the breakdown of the structure causes the total discoloration. Meanwhile under anoxic conditions, a debromination process takes place while the chromophore, and consequently the color of the molecule in solution, remains essentially intact.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the fugitive and undisclosed nature of eosin-derived pigments as used by Vincent van Gogh, this paper presents the syntheses of monometallic and historical bimetallic eosin-based lakes and structural elucidation by MS, ATR-FTIR and NMR. Specifically two monometallic (Al, Pb) and several bimetallic lakes (on varying Al and Pb constituents) have been synthesized and examined alongside two reference compounds: eosin disodium salt and eosin Y. Resulting monometallic lake complexes are 2:1 adducts (dye:metal) with the carboxylic group coordinating the metal. In historical lake preparations, no correlation between the coordinating metals and the resulting lake color can be made. On production and investigations of different eosin lake substrates, two main anchored species have been distinguished: H-bonded for eosin onto Pb-substrates and a further bridged bidentate for eosin onto alumina. A prominent tendency to form 2:1 eosin:Pb adducts emerged in each Pb-containing recipe. Evidence concerning historical lakes suggests that eosin can diversely coordinate to metals thus producing a variety of nuances in according to experimental pH and reaction conditions. This behavior may well explain observed discrepancies between historical recipes and experimental findings regarding the coordination of eosin to one or more metals.},

The book also explains how the history of an object and the meaning that it holds for its owner or custodian contribute to determining its treatment. Conservation Treatment Methodology is an essential text for conservators, historic preservation specialists, and restorers, as well as students. Since it is not a technical manual about how to carry out treatments, the book will also be of value to art historians and museum personnel who work with conservators.},

In general, the life expectancy of most colorants can be increased by such techniques, but a complete halt of the fading process has not been generally observed. In addition, some colorants were found to fade more quickly in an oxygen-free environment. However, it has also been found that at least 90\% of the beneficial influence of an oxygen-free environment can be realized with as much as 0.2\% oxygen (1\% air) remaining in the environment of the colorant. Such an environment might be achieved and maintained at relatively little expense.},

The meeting will take place in the Ernst von Siemens-Auditorium at the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, Germany, from 7-9 November 2012. Selected by a Technical Committee of international specialists, a lively programme of presentations and discussions has been organised. The contributions cover the past and future development of environmental standards, the latest scientific research on materials response, in situ observations of the interaction of historic objects with climate, and methods of environmental control, past, present and future. This will will offer a platform for discussions by conservators, curators, conservation scientists, archivists, registrars, climate engineers, architects, building engineers, decision makers in the cultural field and many more. The conference will be the opportunity to discuss current concerns and questions about environmental standards. Should standards for environmental control become more or less restrictive than the currently accepted international norm? Does predicted climate change necessitate changes in environmental standards? Do arguments about energy costs and sustainability necessitate such changes? Does scientific research, using physical and computer models, reflect the behaviour of real objects? Can surveys of real objects in real environments be used to determine realistic environmental standards? This debate will lead to greater understanding of the factors to be balanced if we are to sustain the mission to save cultural heritage for future generations.},

A special vulnerable category is recommended for objects so light-sensitive that they should only be considered for display under exceptional circumstances. This replaces the category previously named zero tolerance. For the sake of completeness and to ensure well-balanced displays, object types not considered sensitive to light are classified as permanent. A simplified table (Table 2) is included so users can quickly categorize various object types. The paper includes a description of the practical steps taken to comply with the lighting policy during the installation of objects for the refurbished British Galleries at the V\&A.},

It has recently been proposed that these ranges should be relaxed to values that are less energy-intensive to maintain while still being safe for the objects in the collection, with the aim of reducing both carbon footprint and energy use. It is also suggested that conditions should be determined by the needs of individual objects and by the local climate of the region, rather than applying overall values across the museum as a whole. This proposal has led to much discussion within the conservation community. The suggested values, a stable humidity within the range 40–60\% RH and a stable temperature within the range 16–25°C for most objects, apart from the most vulnerable, are derived from the results of experimental research on the responses of individual materials to particular conditions of RH and temperature, as well as observations of the behaviour of cultural heritage objects in their own environments and on loan. This paper describes briefly the historical and scientific background to the present discussion.},

Microclimatic environment characterization has been conducted from December 2008 to September 2009, surveying temperature and relative humidity. Lux and radiation measures have been performed. Moreover punctual microclimatic surveys of surface temperature of a wooden votive tablet, as well as measurements of environment temperature, relative humidity and dew point have been carried out.

The global team of expert authors explain the principal interactions between paper and water, a topic of primary importance for every conservator working with paper artifacts and other cellulose-based materials. The work integrates knowledge from the different disciplines of paper engineering, conservation science and conservation practice, and will serve as a textbook in a rapidly expanding profession that has virtually no customized education literature. Water is present when paper is made. It contributes to its deterioration and serves many essential functions when deteriorated paper is treated by conservators. Drawing on paper industry and science research, Paper and Water examines the relationship between paper and water. Throughout the book, theoretical information concerning basic principles that underlie the interaction of paper and water is presented in close association with practical information that informs the reader about mechanisms that govern conservation procedures. Topics discussed in the book include: structure and properties of dry and wet paper; structure and properties of water; paper production steps relevant to the interaction between paper and water; influence of humid climate conditions on the deterioration of paper; principles of aqueous deacidification; preparation and use of aqueous solutions, methods of treating paper with water, as well as factors influencing their effectiveness; mechanisms of drying paper during its production; methods of drying paper in conservation; historical and ethical dimensions of aqueous treatment in paper conservation. Taking its inspiration from undergraduate and graduate science education textbooks, and tested widely through use in workshops with students and specialist professionals in both Europe and USA, this book is highly illustrated to make learning an efficient and pleasurable experience. Visual material exclusively produced for this publication includes video animations, laboratory videos, and key references which appear on an accompanying DVD.

Starting with the observation that cultural heritage is a cross-cutting field of research where needs are often poorly integrated with each other, a new architecture is required, aimed at solving this integration issue. RICH provides a first step in this direction by addressing several needs in this field through state-of-the-art technologies such as 3D vision and virtualization. The paper outlines the principal building blocks of the architecture by planning and explaining each step in terms of functionality. We also report some preliminary experiences that are being carried out using this architecture. Résumé Dans cet article nous décrivons le RICH : une nouvelle architecture conçue et développée par la Scuola Normale Superiore pour la récolte, la promotion et le partage de données relatives aux biens culturels.

Il en dérive la nécessité d’une nouvelle architecture qui se tourne vers la résolution de ce problème d’intégration. RICH résout de multiples besoins différents moyennant l’utilisation des plus modernes technologies à l’état de l’art comme la vision en 3D et la virtualisation. Il s’agit d’une première réponse vers cette nouvelle direction. Nous avons tracé les parties principales de l’architecture, projetant et expliquant chaque bloc en termes de fonctionnalité.

Hieraus ergibt sich die Notwendigkeit, einer neuen, auf dieses Integrationsproblem abzielenden Architektur. RICH löst von unterschiedlichen Seiten auftretende vielfache Bedürfnisse durch die Anwendung modernster und fachgerechter Technologien wie die 3D-Darstellung und Virtualisierung. Dies ist eine erste, in diese neue Richtung gehende Antwort. Wir haben die wichtigsten Teile der Architektur skizziert und hierbei jeden einzelnen Block hinsichtlich seiner Funktionalität entworfen und erklärt. Darüber hinaus möchten wir einige Voraberfahrungen anführen, die auf der Grundlage dieser Architektur weiter verfolgt werden.},

	abstract = {The Justus Perthes collection of historically valuable maps, dating from late 18 century to the 1960s, was acquired in 2003 by the State of Thuringa and given to the University and Research Library Erfurt/Gotha. The collection consists of more than 185,000 objects, of which 90 \% have a format equal to or smalle r than 96 by 135 cm. Only 10 \% of the maps are much larger in format. The maps are etchings, drawings, lithographs and prints, many of them carrying valuable inscriptions in different media – pencil, crayon, chalk, water colour, gouache and writing ink of diverse composition. The whole collection suffered from contamination with dust particles with a particle size of ≤ 1μm that are harmful upon inhalation and therefore regarded as dangerous for users. To make the collections accessible, the dust contamination was to be diminished to values below the maximum threshold value. A new kind of equipment was engineered that automates the cleaning operation of maps. The cleaning operation could be performed with a speed of 80 items per hour based on a size of 1 m width and a 1.5 m length. Maps are hand fed into a machine, where surface soiling removal is realized by electrostatic foils that are brought in contact to both sides of the maps w ithout any slippage, thus avoiding mechanical impact on th e objects’ surfaces. In the period from July 2008 to August 2010 about 177,000 individual items, that is 96 \% of the collection, underwent successful sur face cleaning and currently are made accessible to r eaders. The automated cleaning exceeded the expectations as far as treatment efficiency and treatment quality is concerned. The risk of mechanical damage that resulted from failures in the feeding and transport system was with less than 0.04 \% extremely low. Even fragile and brittle objects passed the system without any observable mechanical damage. The technique can therefore be regarded as having a very gentle impact on delicate materials, and offers in selected cases an alternative to the conventional manual surface cleaning of paper-based objects. Le nombre des cartes contenues dans la collection Justus Perthes s'élève à environ 185.000, dont 90 \% sont d'un format allant jusqu'à 96 × 135 cm. Par la variété thématique et l'immense richesse de la collection il s'agit d'une source scientifique unique d'importance internationale qui se compose de gravures à l'eau forte, de dessins, de lithographies et d'estampes. Beaucoup de ces cartes sont revêtues d'annotations écrites à la main avec des moyens graphiques et des coloris différents, tels que le crayon, le fusain, la craie, l'aquarelle, la gouache et les encres. Les annotations sont d'une importance historique capitale, ce qui signifie qu'aucune opération technique visant à nettoyer la surface ne doit les altérer ou les effacer. Les cartes sont contaminées par des particules de poussière de taille ? 1 ?m qui sont potentiellement dommageables pour les humains qui les inhalent. Comme toute la collection doit être rendue accessible au public il faut la décontaminer de la poussière ou tout au moins réduire considérablement le seuil de contamination au-dessous duquel elle ne présente plus de danger pour les usagers. Le nouveau système qui a été développé dans ce but permet de nettoyer la surface de 80 cartes d'un format de 1 × 1,50 m par heure de travail. L'élimination de la poussière se réalise sans impact mécanique à l'aide de lamelles chargées électrostatiquement. Cette technique permet de dépoussiérer au maximum les objets tout en conservant complètement les annotations écrites et les coloris. En l'espace de 24 mois, l'équipement “Gothana” de nettoyage de cartes a permis de traiter 96 \% de la collection Justus Perthes de la Bibliothèque de Recherche de l'Université d'Erfurt/Gotha, soit un total de 177.000 pièces intégralement nettoyées avec la plus grande qualité. En termes d'efficacité et de qualité du traitement, les résultats du nettoyage ont dépassé les attentes. Le taux de dégâts dûs aux opérations mécaniques de retrait ou d'insertion dans la machine a été de 0,04 \%, ce qui est extrêmement faible. Même des objets délicats et fragiles ont pu être traités sans dégâts mécaniques visibles. Cette technologie peut ainsi être qualifiée de procédé assurant une sollicitation réduite des objets particulièrement délicats. Dans certains cas, c'est une bonne alternative au nettoyage manuel de surfaces d'objets historiques en papier.},

The pollution results confirm that sheets from mechanical pulps absorb more air pollutants and show a greater brightness loss than lignin-free sheets. However, this does not necessarily result in greeter deterioration of strength properties. A four-day exposure to 10 ppm SO2 and 20 ppm NOx causes a significant acidification and degradation of all papers containing no alkaline reserve. The addition of calcium carbonate as an alkaline reserve is very effective in reducing the negative effect of air pollutants on both lignin-containing and lignin-free sheets.},

Thirty- nine percent of this subset displayed color change in anoxia that was between two and four times lower than that observed in air, whereas 47\% showed color change in anoxia reduced by a factor of four or more. In contrast, six samples exhibited greater color change in anoxia than in air – these samples included Prussian blue watercolor (three samples), Antwerp blue watercolor, Verdigris dry pigment, and Fluorescent Yellow Winsor \& Newton Gouache. Although the results from this small sample subset may cause concern when considering the use of anoxia in the conservation of cultural heritage, particularly for colorant systems whose behavior in anoxia has not yet been identified, this study demonstrates the overwhelming benefits of anoxic light exposure for the vast majority of samples investigated here.},

Using Foucaltian perspectives The Birth of the Museum explores how the public museum should be understood not just as a place of instruction, but as a reformatory of manners in which a wide range of regulated social routines and performances take place. This invigorating study enriches and challenges the understanding of the museum, and places it at the centre of modern relations between culture and government. For students of museum, cultural and sociology studies, this will be an asset to their reading list.},

Twelve samples varying systematically in CIELAB hue at the maximum achievable chroma were used to evaluate color distortion and color clarity. Four neutrals were formulated with a range of color inconstancy under Illuminant A while matching under D65 and four metameric pairs were formulated to represent examples of deceptive restorative inpainting with poor pigment selection with respect to metamerism. This target, still computational, was tested for museum lighting and imaging applications, the results indicative of superior performance compared with conventional color targets and metrics.},

In particular, the spectral data can be used to evaluate potential pigment combinations for inpainting to insure metamerism is minimized. This is a critical criterion because of the wide range of museum lighting and observers, including imaging devices. Recently, a new method of pigment selection for inpainting was developed that successfully minimizes metamerism. Normally, small-aperture spectrophotometers are used. An experiment was performed to test whether this technique could be used with direct digital capture of artwork. Multi-filter colour images were used to estimate spectral reflectance factor. The accuracy of the spectral estimation depended on the spectral properties of the system calibration target. The new method of pigment selection was able to correctly identify pigments from the estimated spectra in many cases. The reported results focus on blue pigments, often a cause of significant metamerism when poorly matched.},

Pigments based on carminic acid are among those particularly prone to color loss, but the mechanism and factors are not well understood. Results We painted out three pigments prepared from the aqueous extract of carminic acid (CA) from Dactylopius coccus: the uncomplexed, and aluminium- and tin-complexed lakes. These were applied in a 2\% gum Arabic solution to papers that were acidic, neutral or alkaline pH and exposed to accelerated light aging in a weatherometer. The comparative rate of fading was dependent on the complexation and on the pH of the substrate. On alkaline paper, the Al complex was least light stable, on neutral paper the three colorants responded similarly, and on acidic paper the tin complex was the least light stable. This is discussed in light of the published information on reactions and mechanism of color loss of CA. Cochineal-based pigments fade on exposure to light. In watercolor paints, the rate depends not only on the complexation of the ligand but also the pH of the paper substrate},

Emphasis is also consistently placed on the experimental basis of the concepts, highlighting the experimental nature of physics. Whenever feasible at the elementary level, concepts relevant to more advanced courses in quantum mechanics and atomic, solid state, nuclear, and particle physics are included.

The study was based upon three cycling situations. The effect of humidity cycling alone was investigated at 90Â°C, 70Â°C, and 50Â°C by exposing the paper samples to three humidity conditions: 60\% RH, 80\% RH, and cycling humidity between 40\% and 80\% RH (with a two-week cycle). The effect of temperature cycling was studied using two separate experimental procedures: 1) exposing the sample to constant RH and 2) keeping samples at constant moisture content in sealed bags. The temperature cycling included three incubation temperatures: 80Â°C, 70Â°C, and daily cycling temperature between 60Â°C and 80Â°C. The rates of paper deterioration were monitored using three indicators of decay: paper discoloration, MIT folds, and tensile properties. Data developed during this study indicated that the rate of paper decay was faster under cycling conditions than at the steady mid-range conditions of the cycles. The data also indicated that the paper decay rate was slower under cycling conditions than it was at the upper limits of the cycles. These observations were consistent for all sets of incubations investigated. These data failed to demonstrate that cycling environments are inherently detrimental to chemical stability in paper. Within the limited framework of this study, the deterioration rates observed with cycling conditions offer no evidence that transitions from one temperature to another or one RH to another provoke a new mechanism of decay or accelerate decay more than would be expected by current thermodynamic models.},

However, the amount that the humidity can fluctuate and the rate at which it can change without causing damage are still unknown. In this study, samples of cotton filter paper (Whatman No. 42) were held at room temperature in a chamber having RH that alternated between 25 and 75\% every two hours. Papers were removed from this chamber at intervals and analyzed for chemical deterioration, discoloration and strength loss. After roughly 2,200 humidity cycles, the paper had suffered a reduction in cellulose degree of polymerization (DP) to one-half its initial value, nearly its leveling-off DP, and its zero-span tensile strength had fallen to one-third the initial fiber strength. Chemical products were found to be consistent with a predominantly hydrolytic degradation. These results, and the course of the strength loss during degradation, suggest that the cycling humidity causes rapid stress-induced hydrolysis in this filter paper.},

	abstract = {The investigation and identification of organic red pigments used in paintings by Vincent van Gogh was a part of the broader research programme into paintings by Van Gogh in his Antwerp and Paris period, November 1885 to February 1888, a project in collaboration between the Van Gogh Museum, the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage and the Shell Research and Technology Centre in Amsterdam. Research results on these pigments used in this period were still lacking and, moreover, the researchers hoped for a better understanding of the ageing properties of the different organic red pigments. The ageing appears as deteriorated (faded) red lake areas, discoloration, fogging and changes in surface texture. It not only harms the art historian’s interpretation of the painting, but it also is a risk for its physical integrity. 41 Paintings of the Van Gogh Museum were examined visually and stereomicroscopically, 52.samples were taken for microscopic study of the paint cross-section and/or chemical analysis (High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with PhotoDiode Array (PDA) and Fluorescence detection) and for Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The techniques are described in an Appendix. All results are presented in a large table with a description of the object and the sample area, the visible deterioration, the microscopic observations, the SEM-EDS analysis, the HPLC analysis and the matrix in which the organic red pigment was identified. The history and way of preparation of the observed organic red pigments is described: cochineal (occurring both as a tin-based lake, together with fine starch grains and as an aluminium/calcium-based lake), madder and Kopp’s purpurin, and redwood. A pigment is either found as the only colouring matter or various pigments occur together in different compositions. Tables are given for (an indication of) the ratio between identified pigments and for the substrates of the colorants. In the course of the analyses a few other organic pigments were found, e.g. methyl violet, unidentified yellow compounds and indigo. Various inorganic pigments and extenders were found in combination with the organic red pigments, e.g. lead white, zinc white, barium sulphate, vermilion, ultramarine, emerald green and viridian. In several cases zinc and/or lead were found without an indication of a lead- or zinc-based pigment. The conclusion was that lead and/or zinc salts would be present as driers. The analytical results are discussed in relation to the condition of the sampled part of the painting. Especially the tin-based cochineal appears to have faded seriously, and almost completely when it was applied as a thin glaze. The use of low-grade pigments, that show serious degradation, shows that the painter had to economize on his materials.},

	title = {Processes inside paintings that affect the picture: chemical changes at, near and underneath the paint surface},
	abstract = {The nature of the surface of the painted picture is determined to a large extent by chemical and physical processes underneath the surface of the paint. The binding medium changes from a chemically drying viscous mass of cross linking polyunsaturated triglycerides “the oil” via slow hydrolytic processes to a metal bound ionomer. This network system in turn appears to be vulnerable to further environmental attack especially by acidifi cation that is postulated to disrupt the ionomeric structure. As a result monocarboxylic fatty acids can be mobilized and reorganize in the form of liquid crystalline masses within the paint layers. When they expand beyond the paint layer, they distort the paint and may erupt at the surface where they protrude or even extrude. These deformations are now recognized in thousands of paintings. Many of these metal soap masses furthermore mineralize forming minium (lead plumbate) and/or leadhydroxy/chloride-carbonates in lead soap or zinc carbonates in the case of zinc soaps. Generally the volume changes due these processes are minimal although the metal soap may grow into larger masses of 100-00 micron diameter. This theory could be developed by an integrated molecular level approach involving GCMS and DTMS work and various forms of chemical microscopy using SIMS, FTIR, Raman and SEM-EDX. The paper furthermore shortly summarises the outcome of the socalled MOLART approach applied to many different problems in paintings in the period 1995-2006.},

En conséquence, si du point de vue de la reconnaissance de l'œuvre d’art en tant que telle, le côté artistique a la priorité absolue, au moment où la reconnaissance cherche à fournir aux générations futures la possibilité de cette révélation, la consistance physique prend une importance primordiale." Voici l'acte de naissance de la restauration du patrimoine. Un manifeste. Avec une grande subtilité, l'auteur livre dans cet ouvrage le fruit de sa pensée critique et de sa riche expérience au contact des œuvres d'art, qu'elles soient picturales, sculpturales ou architecturales. Ayant soin de respecter ce qu'il appelle les deux instances d'une œuvre d'art, l'instance historique et l'instance esthétique, il préconise avant tout de restituer la lisibilité d'une œuvre, de s'interroger sur ce qui, en elle, la constitue en tant qu'œuvre. Et il donne non seulement toute son importance à ce qu'elle fut dans son époque mais aussi à la manière dont elle a traversé l'histoire. Il suggère ainsi d'éventuellement conserver les traces du passage du temps, la patine, comme de laisser voir, de près, l'acte de restauration lui-même, dans le comblement des lacunes par exemple. Enrichi d'appendices décrivant des cas concrets, cet ouvrage donne ainsi la pleine mesure d'une prise en compte de l'histoire d'une œuvre et de ce qu'il doit en apparaitre pour le spectateur d'aujourd'hui. Depuis Brandi, la restauration consiste désormais en une démarche critique, qui évalue à la fois la dimension historique de l'œuvre et son essence artistique.},

The author reflects on these findings from her own perspective and experiences, and places them in the context of two major shifts in heritage research: the first, a shift in focus from conserving materials to managing meaning. The second, a shift in organizational structures from single, centrally funded heritage institutions towards diffuse networks which include new players who have no direct responsibility towards heritage. Both shifts are taking place in an environment of decreased funding and increased accountability to society. Science and conservation connect and contribute to each other most effectively if they together contribute to the societal benefits of heritage. In this regard, heritage science strategies can stimulate collaboration, and direct science and conservation towards innovative, applicable outcomes. Moreover, they can promote a transdisciplinary approach which connects social, economic and business sciences and stakeholders. They should also ensure the creation of sustainable nodes for consolidating knowledge within these dynamic networks.},

Colour measurements during one year on exhibition showed changes that exceeded the limit of one ‘just noticeable change’ in 50 years specified in the policy. In a series of experiments, members of a test panel were all able to perceive the magnitude of colour difference measured in the prints during exhibition when presented with patches of colour side by side, but only half the panel could distinguish the same change when it was seen in the context of a multicoloured image. The change measured in the prints was judged by the panel to represent an average ‘loss of value’ of 9\%, and deemed to be acceptable over a period of 160 years. The outcome suggests exposure of the prints should be further limited for the benefit of future access.},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {Deux rapports des comités réunis en 1850 par le gouvernement Britannique en vue de l'aménagement de la National Gallery, ainsi que les commentaires verbaux des artistes, restaurateurs et autres spécialistes consultés, fournissent d'utiles informations sur les opinions et les techniques de conservation au milieu du 19e siècle. A ce moment l'état des peintures donnait des causes d'inquiétude et l'on critiquait le système de nettoyage. L'atmosphère enfumée de Londres était réputée mauvaise pour les peintures, et Sir Charles Eastlake proposait qu'on installe le système de conditionnement d'air adopté alors au Parlement. Ce système comprenait non seulement la purification par filtrage et lavage, mais était aussi le premier à utiliser l'humidification. Il fut proposé que les peintures soient recouvertes par des verres et leur dos enfermé sous des feuilles d'étain. À Londres, les restaurateurs enlevaient leurs vernis soit par frottement, soit à l'alcool généralement diluté de térébenthine. Peu de restaurateurs enlevaient complètement vernis ou surpeints. Ils évitaient de travailler sur des peintures où une restauration importante était requise (repeints et surpeints). Le vernis le plus utilisé était le mastic, et l'on connaissait les dangers des vernis à l'huile comme dc copal. Le célèbre 'Gallery varnish' (employé à la Gallery) et utilisé seulement par le restaurateur John Seguier, était un mastic mélangé d'huile de lin cuite avec des siccatifs au plomb. Il était surtout utilisé pour empêcher le 'chanci' mais il noircissait vite et était universellement critiqué. Le 'chanci' selon les témoignages, se produisait uniquement aux Galeries de Londres et de Dresden; il était dû aux gaz sulfureux de la fumée de charbon. Selon la théorie moderne, prouvée d'ailleurs par les rapports fournis aux comités, il résulterait du dépôt de sulfate d'ammonium provenant de l'atmosphère chargée de fumées de charbon et de vapeurs ammoniacales. D'après le peintre Dyce, le vernis Armenino, mélange d' 'olio d'abezzo' et d' 'olio di sasso' devait s'utiliser au-dessus du mastic habituel, et devait être retiré chaque année en entraînant les dépôts de suie et de graisses accumulés; il se dissolvait facilement à la térébenthine sans altérer la couche de mastic. Les vernis teintés étaient fréquemment utilisés en ce temps, mais les restaurateurs de la National Gallery n'en faisaient pas usage. Le vernis Dammar était très employé en Allemagne à ce moment, il était préféré au mastic pour les peintures anciennes. Il avait récemment été introduit à Florence. En Angleterre, un seul restaurateur l'employait régulièrement parce que le mastic vendu à cette époque était falsifié par des baumes. L'on ne pratiquait presque pas le rentoilage à la National Gallery par crainte des dommages, mais la technique en était bien connue. Le chimiste Michael Faraday avait fait des essais pour déterminer jusqu'à quel point les couches de peintures étaient protégées des gaz sulfureux par les vernis, il avait également fait des recherches sur les solvants. On discuta l'engagement d'un chimiste chargé de l'étude des vernis et des solvants.},

Two case studies have been selected for environmental monitoring, one with a very stable environment and the other on extremely unstable environment throughout the year. A total of eight data loggers were used over a 12-month period. Macro- and microclimates under different conditions were investigated by monitoring and analysing conditions within two dummy books, empty and fully packed shelves and both ambient and external conditions. Resulting data have assisted in explaining the interaction between paper and its immediate environment, and confirmed that the microenvironment of a confined space is influenced by the amount of paper housed within it. Moreover, it is suggested that the overall surface area are available for environmental interaction is more important than the paper type or book size. In addition, paper may have a negative impact during certain times of the year, forcing its environment to higher RH levels during dryer seasons by desorbing excess moisture.},

	abstract = {The material analysis of 18th century manuscripts yields a significant amount of clues. A detailed and methodological inventory, not limited to a list of watermarks, allows us to identify the different types of paper used by Diderot, Buffon or Condorcet. However, this codicological data can only be exploited if referred to the history of paper making in the pre-industrial era: a critical approach to format, provenance and elements allowing dating is essential. Codicology also enlightens us on the various paper uses: folding, cutting, assembling and re-using were common gestures in the 18th century, as much of the secretaries as of the authors themselves. This practice favors the plasticity and mobility of textual units: Montesquieu’s pinned-on “butterflies”, Rousseau’s notes on playing cards, quarto notebooks for l’Esprit des Lois or l’Histoire naturelle. Thus, by approaching the written object in its strictly material dimension we can associate the study of intellectual practices and the creative processes with the history of paper’s consumption and usage. L’analyse matérielle des manuscrits du xviiie siècle procure une moisson d’indices non négligeables. Un inventaire méthodique détaillé (ne se limitant pas au relevé de filigranes) permet d’identifier les différents types de papier employés par Diderot, Buffon ou Condorcet. Toutefois, ces données codicologiques ne deviennent exploitables que si l’on se réfère à l’histoire de la fabrication du papier à l’ère préindustrielle : une approche critique des formats, des provenances et des éléments de datation s’avère nécessaire. La codicologie donne aussi accès aux usages du papier : plier, découper, assembler et réemployer sont des gestes courants au xviiie siècle, tant du fait des secrétaires que des auteurs eux-mêmes. Ces pratiques favorisent la plasticité et la mobilité des unités textuelles : « papillons » épinglés de Montesquieu, fiches sur cartes à jouer de Rousseau, cahiers in-4° de l’Esprit des Lois ou de l’Histoire naturelle. Ainsi l’approche de l’objet écrit dans sa dimension la plus strictement matérielle permet d’articuler l’étude des pratiques intellectuelles et des processus créatifs avec l’histoire de la consommation et des usages du papier.},

	abstract = {Abstract The study of effects of basic compounds on pure cellulose paper has been extended to sodium and lithium carbonates and bicarbonates. In order to avoid interference with pre-existing basic impurities, the paper was thoroughly deionized, and part of it was also used to repeat treatments with alkaline-earth bases. A variety of conditions have been employed for aging: 105 and 85°C without moisture, then 85 and 60°C at 68\% RH: the latter humidity corresponds to a water content in the cellulose equivalent to that at 23°C and 50\% RH. Aging at 105 and 85°C was up to a month, whereas at 50°C it has been extended to over four months. On cellulose so purified, alkaline-earth carbonates did not cause an inverted behavior on changing from dry to humid conditions, the rate of degradation of treated paper being practically independent of moisture, which instead greatly increased that of untreated samples. Also a small amount of alkaline carbonates retarded depolymerization in dry aging, and traces of them even in a moist environment. But at that humidity level, which is now recognized as more meaningful than dryness, the effect of sodium and lithium carbonates changed dramatically with increasing concentrations: yellowing, depolymerization and pH lowering greatly exceeded, at the higher contents, those of untreated controls. Acidic products were obtained, which were shown to contain carboxylic acids and their salts by infrared and ultraviolet analysis. (IPC 10th Anniversary Conference "New Directions in Paper Conservation," Oxford 1986). Résumé La cellulose provenant du papier de qualité chromatographique et incorporant des quantités diverses de carbonates et/ou d'hydrates d'éléments alcalins ou alcalino-terreux, a été soumise à un vieillissement dans des environnements secs et humides, à des températures allant de 60°C à 105°C. Les valeurs du pH extractif, du contenu alcalin, de l'éclat. de DP, du contenu des groupes DP, CO et COOH pour des échantillons conservés a 60°C et 65\% R. H. pendant plus de 4 mois, sont ici indiquées en detail. Cette dernière condition semble se rapprocher le plus de vieillissement naturel normal à température ambiante. Tout en confirmant la protection globale que donnent au papier des traitements utilisant des composes de base de calcium, magnesium et barium (lorsqu'ils laissent des dépôts insolubles), cette étude a démontré sans doute possible les effets délétères de composés analogues du sodium, pour des concentrations supérieures à un niveau minimum très faible. Ces derniers ont produit, entre autres, une quantité considérable de carboxyles solubles dans I'eau (confirmés par analyse infrarouge), avec pour conséquence une diminution soudaine en pH d'extraction.},

A rigourous treatment and a background familiarity with the underlying physics behind mathematics are covered, giving a detailed description and interpretation of the main microphysical phenomena, removing unsound popular beliefs. The basis are given for non-destructive diagnostics to evaluate causes of damage determined by atmoshpheric factors, as well as negative consequences of the unsound use of technology and mass tourism. To this aim, suggestions are given on the fundamental principles in designing heating, air conditioning, lighting and in reducing the deposition of pollutants on works of art. Theory and experience are coupled to describe the complex condensation mechanisms and the fundamental role played by water in the stone deterioration and the formation of crusts on monuments. Urban meteorology, air-surface interactions, atmospheric stability, dispersion and deposition of airborne pollutants are also key topics of this book, for which the main aim has been to make comprehensible to a wider audience a matter that is only familiar to a few specialists. This book combines a theoretical background with many years of accurate laboratory research, field surveys and practice. The first part, devoted to applied theory, is a concise treatise on microphysics, which includes a survey on the basic ideas which are necessary for environmental diagnostic and conservation. The second part of the book focuses on the practical utilisation and shows in detail how field surveys should be performed, with many suggestions and examples and the indication of some common errors that should be avoided.},

Climatic and chemical factors have a combined weathering effect which becomes more dangerous when the time of wetness or atmospheric pollution goes up, or there is an increase in the concentration of catalysts. Rain transports acid substances from the atmosphere to monuments, especially in northern and central Europe. The meteorological nature of the precipitation, i.e. showers or drizzle is of great importance. The pattern of the white and black crusts on the monuments is caused by the way rainwater wets the surface. In southern Europe the photo-oxidants and the dry deposited gases and particles are dominant, especially in urban sites. The diurnal thermal cycles due to sunlight may mean that the monuments are subjected to great ranges of temperature and condensation - evaporation cycles. The microclimate, as well as being responsible for mechanical stress, thermohygrometric cycles and providing conditions suitable for biological degradation in low polluted areas, governs the rate of the dry deposition. Indoors, the microclimate depends on: external climatic factors, the way the environment is managed and presence of visitors. The problems related to artificial lighting, heating, air conditioning and cleaning are therefore discussed.},

Following a pilot, it was decided that the scope of the project needed to alter to address risk awareness of the whole heritage asset, rather than just collections, with the aim of improving organisational sustainability and resilience. A multidisciplinary team used the recognised STEEPLED methodology to develop the Risk Awareness Preservation Tool (RAPT) on-line tool that was launched in 2010. The novel aspects of the tool are that it is easy to complete; provides an immediate assessment of awareness; provides help and direction in addressing areas of weakness; and the data gathered can be analysed to inform strategic planning at local, regional and national levels.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the role played by pigment particle size in pigment-binder interactions, and thus susceptibility to aging of azurite-rabbit glue paint dosimeters upon accelerated UV-aging versus outdoor sunlight exposure. A complementary multi-analytical approach, including spectroscopic and surface analytical techniques, was applied to characterize commercial azurite pigments, as well as blank and aged dosimeters. Results show the crucial role played by azurite particle size on protein-copper complex formation, which governed physico-chemical properties of paints and their aging behavior under different light-aging conditions. On UV-aged dosimeters, finer particles promoted stronger binder structural changes, inducing more severe color changes ( D E 1⁄4 6e17). Azurite size also controlled crack formation which was more severe as pigment grain increased due to greater accumulation of binder in inter-pore spaces. Outdoor exposure caused important binder loss (50-60\%) and initial transformation of azurite into malachite. Since analyzed pigment composition and particle size differed from manufacturer data, we recommend their characterization prior to use in conservation works and scientific studies. Based on these results, paints made of coarse azurite particles are preferable since they are less prone to color change. Moreover, a small addition of fine-grained pigments might reduce crack development upon aging.},

From this perspective, sociology can help curators and conservators to understand the manner in which their own arguments, ideas, and interpretative ideas are constructed with regard to “national heritage,” by granting them the tools to analyze the sources of object construction as “transmitters” of identity. In this way, the conceptual foundation for a reflective exercise is proposed, which leads to a means of interpreting cultural heritage in a way that outlines its reinsertion into social space, all the while remaining conscious of the construction mechanisms of its “burden of identity.”},

Naturally there are compromises, since modern materials are unlikely to have precisely the same chemical and morphological identity as those used in the past.

The status of the operator was lower than that of the painting restorer, which reflected the complex hierarchy within cultural heritage.

	abstract = {Understanding how objects respond to ambient relative humidity (RH) and temperature changes helps in managing the museum environment. Collections respond in various ways and at different speeds to the amount of moisture and heat in the air. Very damp conditions encourage mould and fungal growth. Absorption of moisture by objects made of plant or animal material (organic) makes them swell. As conditions dry out, this has the opposite effect, causing shrinkage. Organic objects may be made up of a combination of different materials, each of which will respond to moisture in a different way. The dimensional changes in different materials cause internal stresses, leading to cracking and failure of joints. Fragile objects with a layered structure, such as ivory or veneered furniture, behave in two ways: they can expand and contract at different rates lengthwise and widthwise. This has the same effect as if the object was made of different materials. Objects that are metallic or mineral in nature react in different ways to changes in RH and temperature. Excessive RH causes corrosion such as rust in iron, pyrite disease in fossils, or leaching in glass, which causes droplets to form on the surface. Museums must record changes in the environment within their buildings in order to gauge the level of environmental stress to which objects are subjected. This requires monitoring equipment capable of recording relative humidity and temperature over time. RH and temperature monitoring equipment is designed to respond to environmental changes in a similar way to the materials from which objects are made. The fact that a recording thermohygrograph registers RH changes through expansion and contraction of human hair, and temperature changes through the response of a bimetallic strip, is no accident. The result is that we are not only interested in the absolute values of data that are recorded. We are also interested in the rate or speed of change that occurs, and because different materials, whether objects or monitoring devices, respond to changes over time, we sometimes detect a slight hysteresis, or time delay between cause and effect - between a change in conditions and the response of the material to the change. The aim of these Guidelines is to help museums make the most of the environmental data they collect. Without understanding the information contained in the data, monitoring becomes a pointless task that does not benefit the collection.},

	abstract = {In this work, a novel combination of portable micro-Raman spectroscopy and semi-automatic methods of data treatment are proposed for the classification and mapping of visible multispectral imaging data for the analysis of a painting on paper by Vincent Van Gogh. Analysis of multispectral imaging data with the sequential maximum-angle convex cone (SMACC) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithms differentiated the surface into areas on the basis of the presence of pigment mixtures. Complementary analytical information was obtained through portable Raman spectroscopy was performed on a few selected points of the painting, allowing for the determination of Van Gogh’s palette and the mapping of pigment mixtures on the painting’s surface; the number of mixtures employed is varied and at least two different blues are present. The results obtained were integrated with the information from prior ultraviolet (UV)-induced luminescence analysis performed on the same painting to better understand the materials used by the artist. The mathematical treatment of multispectral data using the proposed methods could be extended to the analysis of other painted surfaces.},

The defined spectra of reference sources for the characterization of UV radiometers are given in Annex A.

The in situ investigation revealed the presence of an unusual microsecond green emission from the white painted areas of the watercolour, and this long-lived emission has not been reported in modern paintings by other authors. In order to attribute and suggest an identification of the luminescent pigment, our analysis was integrated with further measurements on commercially available modern white pigments (zinc white, Lithopone white, Blanc Fixe, zinc sulphide, and copper-doped zinc sulphide) and with an in-depth study of the synthesis processes of zinc-based pigments available at the end of the 19th century. Analysis suggested an attribution of the unusual emission from the Van Gogh painting to a particular variety of zinc sulphide pigment, characterized by the presence of copper impurities which were unintentionally introduced in the crystal matrix during its production. The present study is the first application of lifetime imaging for the mapping of long-lived luminescence from the semi-conductor pigment.},

These require presentation which reveals their intrinsic visible characteristics with accuracy and honesty, and the term ’exhibition’ is used to distinguish this process from display. It requires that the entire setting, including lighting, develops from an aim to reveal works of art rather than to enhance them, and the notion of ’the well-lit room’ is promoted as a concept which expresses the essentials of this design approach. However, it is evident that these may conflict with recommended illuminance maxima, particularly the 50 lux level for more sensitive objects. A working model of the photochemical processes is proposed to give an improved basis for specifying control of lighting. Limiting values of annual damage exposure are derived from the current illuminance maxima recommendations; these permit a more flexible approach to reconciling competing requirements for exhibition and conservation. Also, the model provides a framework which enables information relating to exposure of materials and to means for controlling degradation to be evaluated in terms which can readily be related to actual conditions of exhibition m museums and art galleries.},

	volume = {5},
	doi = {10.1186/s40494-017-0120-y},
	abstract = {The characterisation of atelier materials and of the historical commercial formulation of paint materials has recently gained new interest in the field of conservation science applied to modern and contemporary art, since modern paint materials are subjected to peculiar and often unpredictable degradation and fading processes. Assessing the composition of the original materials purchased by artists can guide not only their identification in works of art, but also their restoration and conservation. Advances in characterisation methods and models for data interpretation are particularly important in studying organic coloring materials in the transition period corresponding to the late 19th–early 20th century, when many such variants or combinations were hypothetically possible in their formulations. There is thus a need for reliable databases of materials introduced in that period and for gaining chemical knowledge at a molecular level related to modern organic pigments, by state-of-the-art protocols. This paper reports on the results of a study on 44 samples of historical colorants in powder and paint tubes, containing both lake pigments and synthetic organic pigments dating from 1890 to 1926. The samples were collected at the Lefranc Archive in Le Mans (France) as a part of Project Futurahma “From Futurism to Classicism (1910–1922). Research, Art History and Material Analysis”, (FIRB2012, Italian Ministry of University and Research), and were investigated using an analytical approach based on chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques. The focus of the chemical analyses was to reveal the composition of the historical organic lake pigments including minor components, to discriminate between different recipes for the extraction of chromophore-containing molecules from the raw materials, and ultimately to distinguish between different formulations and recipes. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD) or electrospray-Quadrupole-Time of Flight tandem mass spectrometry detector (ESI-Q-ToF) were chosen given their considerable capacity to identify such complex and widespread organic materials. Although the inorganic components of the pigments were not taken into account in this survey, the specific molecular profiles provided invaluable information on the extraction procedures or synthetic strategy followed by the different producers, at different times. For instance, the use of Kopp’s purpurin and garancine was highlighted, and synthetic by-products were identified. The results provided evidence that the addition of synthetic organic pigments to paint mixtures started from 1910 onwards, but they also suggest that in the formulation of high quality (surfin) colorants, natural products were still preferred. Moreover, in one of the samples the use of murexide as the colouring material was confirmed. This paper presents the first systematic and comprehensive survey on organic lakes and pigments belonging to an historical archive, by both HPLC-DAD and HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF. Specific by-products of synthetic production of pigments, which can act as specific molecular markers for dating or locating a work of art, were also identified for the first time.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40494-016-0075-4},
	abstract = {Background Imaging spectroscopy, the collection of spatially co-registered images in many contiguous spectral bands, has been developed for remote sensing of the Earth utilizing reflectance or luminescence. In this paper we summarize findings on the application of imaging spectroscopy to works of art in order to identify and map artists’ pigments, improve the visualization of preparatory sketches, and identify non-original material. Methods Two types of novel hyperspectral cameras, one operating from the visible to near-infrared (VNIR, 400–900 nm) and the other in the shortwave infrared (SWIR, 950–1700 nm), have been used to collect diffuse reflectance spectral image cubes from a variety of paintings. The resulting cubes (400–1700 nm, 310 spectral bands) were calibrated to reflectance and the resulting spectra compared with point–based spectra collected with a fiber reflectance spectrometer (350–2500 nm). In addition, a calibrated multispectral camera (600–950 nm, eight spectral bands) was used to obtain luminescence spectral image cubes after exciting paintings at blue wavelengths. Results False–color images obtained from the SWIR imaging system are shown to give improved visualization of changes from paintings having large and complex reworkings, e.g. Pablo Picasso’s The Tragedy (1903). False–color images and reflectance spectra allowed definitive identification of restoration in a late 13th century Sienese painting that cannot be seen by traditional infrared reflectography. Spectral image processing on the reflectance image cubes have been used to identify the primary pigments or pigment mixtures. For example, the primary pigments and their distribution in Picasso’s Peonies (1901) was determined and compared with x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x–ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS). Conclusion The results show that the combination of both the SWIR reflectance data and the luminescence data provides a more robust ability to assign the pigments than with visible spectroscopy alone. Also highlighted is the utility of reflectance imaging spectroscopy in the SWIR region to better reveal specific paint changes, including changes in the drawings and markings made by the original artist, or changes made by a subsequent conservator such as a fill.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40494-017-0146-1},
	abstract = {Infrared reflectography (IRR) remains an important method to visualize underdrawing and compositional changes in paintings. Older IRR camera systems are being replaced with near-infrared cameras consisting of room temperature infrared detector arrays made out of indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) that operate over the spectral range of 900 to 1700 nm. Two camera types are becoming prevalent. The first is staring array infrared cameras having 0.25–1 Megapixels where the camera or painting is moved to acquire tens of individual images that are later mosaicked together to create the infrared reflectogram. The second camera type is scanning back cameras in which a small InGaAs array (linear or area array) is mechanically scanned over a large image formed by the camera lens to create the reflectogram, typically 16 Megapixels. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. The staring IR array cameras offer more flexible collection formats, provide live images, and allow for the use of spectral bandpass filters that can provide reflectograms with better contrast in some cases. They do require a mechanical system for moving the camera or the artwork and post-capture image mosaicking. Scanning back cameras eliminate or reduce the amount of mosaicking and movement of the camera, however the need to minimize light exposure to the artwork requires short integration times, and thus limits the use of spectral bandpass filters. In general, InGaAs cameras are not sensitive in the 1700 to 2300 nm spectral region, which has been identified in prior studies as useful for examining paintings with copper green pigments or thick lead white paints. Prior studies using cameras with sensitivity from 1000 to 2500 nm have found in general the performance at wavelengths longer than 1700 nm degraded relative to the performance at shorter wavelengths. Thus, there is interest in a camera system having improved performance out to 2500 nm that can utilize spectral bandpass filters. Methods Design requirements for such an improved IRR camera system were determined by first re-examining the optimal spectral window for detecting underdrawing. Thus the wavelength dependence of the clarity of carbon black underdrawings on a chalk ground covered by various paint swatches was measured from 750 to 2500 nm. Second, analysis of the loss of light transmission (1000–2500 nm) and the impact of thermal radiation (3000–5000 nm) on the performance of IR arrays sensitive to the 1000–5000 nm region was analyzed. From the results of these studies, a high sensitivity, near-infrared (1000–2450 nm) indium antimonide (InSb) staring array camera with a cold filter that blocked light {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextgreater2450 nm was constructed with a color-corrected macro lens capable of holding interference filters. The camera system was characterized in three spectral bands (1100–1400, 1500–1800, and 2100–2400 nm) using test targets and art objects. Results The experimental results of the contrast difference between the model underdrawing on the chalk ground showed the optimal spectral window for a given pigment varied over the range from 700 to 2300 nm. The contrast in all cases was found to be low from 2300 to 2600 nm and even lower from 2600 to 5000 nm. This is attributable in part to broad absorption by the drying oil paint binder. Performance testing of the IRR camera found high signal-to-noise was observed in all three spectral bands due to the optimized macro lens having high transmission from 1000 to 2600 nm, a 100\% efficiency cold stop, and a cold filter that blocks light {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextgreater2450 nm. The camera was found to have high light sensitivity, requiring only 30 to 50 lx from incandescent lamps having a color temperature of 2060 K. The images produced in each spectral band were sharp, and the modulation at Nyquist (1/2 the sampling frequency) was 20\%. IRR images of Old Master paintings, works on paper, and a warped panel painting were collected to test the practical utility of the camera system. Conclusions The IR camera system presented here was found to produce a variety of high-resolution image products. The ability to extend image collection over the 1700–2450 nm spectral range was found in some examples to provide improved visibility of underdrawing. The ability to register the resulting multi-band IRR images with the color image offers opportunities to produce new image products such as false-color images and principal component images. These image products were found to give new insights into the construction of works of art. A collection scheme based on a ‘Z-stack’ method was found to solve the problem of producing high-resolution IRR images of highly warped panel paintings.},

	title = {Optimising {Light} {Source} {Spectrum} to {Reduce} the {Energy} {Absorbed} by {Objects}},
	abstract = {Light is used to illuminate objects in the built environment. Humans can only observe light reflected from an object. However, light absorbed by an object turns into heat and does not contribute to visibility. Since the spectral output of the new lighting technologies can be tuned, it is possible to imagine a lighting system that detects the colours of objects and emits customised light to minimise the absorbed energy. Several previous optimisation studies investigated the use of narrowband light sources to maximise the luminous efficacy and colour quality of a light source. While these studies aimed to tune a white light source for general use, the lighting system proposed here minimises the energy consumed by lighting by detecting the individual colours of objects and emitting customised light onto each coloured part of the object. This thesis investigates the feasibility of absorption-minimising light source spectra and their impact on the colour appearance of objects and energy consumption. Two computational studies (papers 1 and 2) were undertaken to form the theoretical basis of the absorption-minimising light source spectra. Computational simulations show that the theoretical single-peak test light sources can lower the energy consumption up to around 38 \% to 62 \%, and double-peak test light sources can result in energy savings of up to 71 \%, without causing colour shifts in the appearance of test samples. In these studies, standardised reference illuminants, theoretical test spectra and coloured test samples were used. These studies are followed by the empirical evidence collected from two psychophysical experiments. Data from the experiments show that observers find the colour appearance of objects equally natural and attractive under spectrally optimised test light sources and reference white light sources. An increased colour difference, to a certain extent, is found acceptable, which allows even higher energy savings. However, the translucent nature of some objects may negatively affect the results. Future studies will investigate the spatial resolution needed to implement such a lighting system and employ object colour hue groupings, instead of single colours.},

These quantities may then be plotted to show the color change kinetics of selected colorants on artifacts. Thus it combines the features of fiber-optic reflectance spectrophotometry (FORS) with traditional accelerated light aging.

In the absence of round robin testing at the time, concerns over the comparability of these innovations led the authors to purchase the parts needed to recreate five instruments for a side-by-side comparison. In this manner the instruments could be tested holding variables related to user experience and protocols constant. A set of seventeen test colorants were selected that included both new and historical materials. All three CIE color difference equations used in making color change assessments were evaluated. The question was asked, “How often would the microfaders facilitate an assessment to within 1⁄2 step of an ISO blue wool step in equivalent lightfastness?” As a result of those tests more than 12,000 spectra were collected and analyzed. The results stood out in good agreement and our 1⁄2 step criterion was matched or exceeded 70\% if the time and was matched or exceeded to 1 full step 95\% of the time. This paper describes the details of those experiments.},

This indicator, named LightCheck ® Ultra, is composed of a photosensitive dye/polymer layer applied on a paper support. The indicator is characterized by a progressive colour variation as the exposure to light increases. Initially blue, the colour successively changes through purple and pink to white, under the effect of visible light. The colour variation was investigated under different environmental conditions. The light-induced alterations under study were evaluated using various light sources and illuminance levels. The impact of other factors unconnected to light (such as temperature, humidity, indoor air pollution – atmospheric and volatile organics – and oxygen) was also studied. The behaviour of the indicator in the field in selected museums and historic houses was assessed in parallel with the laboratory experiments at each development stage. Finally, the calibration was carried out and a reference colour scale was provided for fast and easy reading of the indicator. By means of this reference colour scale, the colour exhibited by the dosimeter after an exposure can be easily correlated to a quantitative indication of the light dose received. The phases of development and testing of this novel light dosimeter are presented in detail, from the early design to the final product.},

Many recommendations were based on considerations other than permanence of the objects, such as mechanical limitations of HVAC systems, constraints imposed by the exterior climate or historic building regulations, or costs of implementation and maintenance. It is only relatively recently that research has provided a general scientific basis for determining appropriate values for the museum climate, especially the range in which temperature and relative humidity can be safely allowed to vary. Because the results of this research differed from what had become climatic dogma, it was criticized by some in the field.

This was much more problematic because the interventions were occasional and limited, but did allow to put into place a methodology and the correct use of chemical dosimeters such as LightCheck.

Newly developed lighting systems render the selection of suitable light sources more difficult, not least in the context of energy–economical systems. This study accordingly examines different lighting systems (fluorescent tubes, halogen lamps, low-voltage metal halide lamps, and LED lamps) in terms of the damage potential they hold for the materials concerned. The changes in color were evaluated using the CIEDE2000 color-difference formula. This study focuses on selected organic materials and shows that changes in color already occur after only a brief exposure time. The color changes induced by the fluorescent tubes were consistently more intense than those induced by the other light sources. The results obtained with the remaining lamps show that the color changes depend more on the material under investigation than on the source used. The changes determined after a relatively short exposure period (five months) vividly demonstrate that exposing sensitive materials to light for longer terms (as is the case during a permanent exhibition) is most definitely a non-viable option.},

The painting contains a field of white, green, orange, and yellow flowers under a canopy of poplar trees with two central figures—a man and a woman, arms entwined. From Van Gogh’s letters, however, it is known that he painted the picture with some pink flowers, which appear to have altered, presumably to white. Raman spectroscopy was applied to microsamples of paint to identify the faded pigment as geranium lake, which in this painting consists of the dye, eosin (2 0 ,4 0 ,5 0 ,7 0 -tetrabromofluorescein). For the first time, lead(II) sulfate has been specifically identified as the likely inorganic substrate for a geranium lake used by Van Gogh in the last months of his life. Microfocus X-ray fluorescence (MXRF) spectroscopy was subsequently used in situ to analyze the white flowers to identify bromine as a proxy for eosin, thus indicating an original pink coloration. Of the 387 white flowers analyzed, 37.7\% contained measurable bromine and were, therefore, originally pink. Several cross-sections from these formerly pink areas were assessed using a combination of visual inspection and microcolorimetry to create a colored mask in Adobe Photoshop to digitally reconstruct a suggestion of the original appearance of the painting with regard to the faded flowers. Additionally, microfadeometry was undertaken for the first time on a painting cross-section sample to understand the actual fading kinetics of the underlying bright pink geranium lake used by Van Gogh. A combination of Raman micro-spectroscopy, MXRF, and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) were utilized in situ and on paint microsamples to identify the complete palette used to create Undergrowth with Two Figures.},

	abstract = {Conservators and scholars long have been interested in understanding the traditional color palette of Japanese woodblock prints. Some of the traditional organic colorants are very difficult to distinguish visually, particularly if faded or decolorized. For decades ultraviolet and infrared examination of colorants in oil paintings have served as powerfully revealing tools. Ultraviolet light has sometimes been used to examine Japanese woodblock prints as well. This research focuses on differentiating non-synthetic reds and the three main blues employed in traditional Japanese woodblock prints produced in Edo between 1740 and 1890, using combined observations of daylight-fluorescent, ultraviolet, and infrared examination. The twenty-three prints under study belong to the Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division. As part of this research project, Sandra Connors and Paul Whitmore, of the Research center on the Materials of the Artist and the Conservator at Carnegie Mellon University, measured the light fugitiveness of the print colors using a micro-fading tester. This instrument also produced reflectance spectra that were useful in identifying safflower red, vermilion, indigo blue, dayflower blue, and through a process of elimination, Prussian blue. The instrumental data for reds and blues in each print was correlated to visual examination of the prints in daylight- balanced fluorescent lighting, recorded using Munsell color chips, and examination under long wave ultraviolet light and with an infrared video camera. The resulting characterization of these colorants using ultraviolet and infrared radiation, both "low-tech" resources, will enable scholars and conservators to more easily assess historic and artistic trends in the Japanese woodblock palette.},

It is an accelerated light exposure method for rapidly and nondestructively estimating the fading rates of colorants on real objects that relies on measuring the early response of a submillimetre spot of colorant exposed to megalux levels of light. While the main benefit is better identification and protection for the most light-sensitive elements of a collection, it has also been shown to have very significant access, financial, and operational benefits. The basic equipment is suitable for routine screening by a trained conservator in a museum. Alternatively many institutions’ needs may be met using a contract service. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the technique’s development, and how it is used as a tool for collection management and research.},

	abstract = {The response of over 100 historic iron gall inks on paper and parchment to continuous and interrupted accelerated light exposure in modified environments was investigated. In air, spontaneous post-fading colour reversion was consistently observed; however, in near-anoxic conditions it was suppressed and the initial response usually moderately accelerated. These and other results suggest a Prussian blue-like response involving photoreduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and reoxidation by molecular oxygen. The pre-reversion response was substantially independent of relative humidity. The results invalidate previous fading-rate estimates based on non-interrupted accelerated exposure studies, and the most straightforward interpretation suggests that low-oxygen display cases are unlikely to mitigate, and may even accelerate, the light fading of iron gall inks.},

	abstract = {In late 2007 the authors were asked to review the National Museum of Australia’s lighting guide-lines because the Conservation and Finance Managers had serious concerns about the cost of light-driven object replacements. Two underlying factors, both potentially able to be addressed, were found to be responsible for the high replacement rate. The first was a lack of reliable fading-rate data for much of the collection, leading both to conservative and inflexible display restrictions and probable over-exposure of the most fugitive colorants, which could not be reliably identified. The second was an implicit assumption that, for the purposes of setting display periods, all objects are equally likely to be displayed, and therefore equally exposed to light over time. The Museum subsequently acquired an Oriel® Fading Test System by Spectra Physics that has proven to be a highly cost effective means of distinguishing materials at real risk of unacceptable fading from those for which exhibition times may safely be extended. The micro-fading results inform a lighting regimen in which objects of high significance to the museum, and therefore likely to be in regular demand for exhibition, are given the same or less exposure per exhibition period than before, and the majority of less-used items allowed more exposure when exhibited. This dual approach allows the museum to concentrate its resources on the most important, most displayed, most fugitive – and therefore most vulnerable – colorants in the collection.},

The book provides a comprehensive presentation of the fundamental principles and applications of modern laser technology in the analysis of composition, diagnostics of structural integrity, and conservation of artworks and antiquities. Beginning with an introduction to the basic techniques used in art conservation and archeology, the book describes the fundamental aspects of laser-matter interactions, emphasizing laser diagnostics and laser processing applications. The next few chapters focus on laser-based spectroscopic techniques for the analysis of the composition of materials in art and archaeology, including laser-induced breakdown, Raman, and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. The book proceeds to highlight nondestructive diagnostic techniques, laser processing applications, laser applications for the cleaning of paintings and stone, and methods for the removal of encrustations. It concludes with case studies for the conservation of materials like parchment, paper, metal, ivory, and wood, and includes conservation approaches for modern paintings. Bridging science with art, Lasers in the Preservation of Cultural Heritage presents a systematic overview of the fundamentals and applications of laser techniques in artwork conservation and archeological science.},

To get an idea of how this painting, as well as other works by Van Gogh, looked shortly after their production, the Revigo (Re-assessing Vincent van Gogh’s colors) research project was initiated. The aim of this project was to digitally visualize the original colors of paintings and drawings by Vincent van Gogh, using scientific methods backed by expert judgement where required. We adopted an experimental art technological approach and physically reconstructed Van Gogh’s full palette of oil paints, closely matching those he used to paint Field with Irises near Arles. Sixteen different paints were reconstructed, among which the most light-sensitive pigments and linseed oil, which is prone to yellowing, were produced according to 19th century practice. The resulting pigments and oils were chemically analyzed and compared to those used by Van Gogh. The ones that resembled his paints the most were used in the paint reconstructions. Other pigments were either obtained from the Cultural Heritage Agency’s collection of historical pigments, or purchased from Kremer Pigmente. The reconstructed paints were subsequently used to calculate the absorption K and scattering S parameters of the individual paints. Using Kubelka–Munk theory, these optical parameters could in turn be used to determine the color of paint mixtures. We applied this method successfully to digitally visualize the original colors of Field with Irises near Arles. Moreover, the set of optical parameters presented here can similarly be applied to calculate digital visualizations of other paintings by Van Gogh and his contemporaries.},

The physical condition and environment of the coloring matter appear to be principal factors determinipg the shape; a change in concentration does not usually change the class of fade. Class I fades are approximately first-order curves and are indicative of dye dispersed as single molecules or very small associated units. Class II fades are initially class I but later become linear (zero order), probably because a high proportion of coloring matter either is firmly embedded in the substrate molecules or is present as relatively large associated units. Class III fades resemble the later portion of Class II for similar reasons. Class IV fades have a point of inflection, with a more rapid fade following an initial slow change or even an apparent negative fade, i.e., an increase in depth of color; class V fades accelerate continuously from the start. Both classes IV and V are believed to be the result of combined effects of light and heat on aggregated particles of color. A theoretical treatment of these conditions is given.},

In this the rate of oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere is considered, first in traversing the polymeric substrate, and then in entering an embedded colorant particle, under illumination. Expressions are derived which show that the rate of fading should vary with 1/a 2 (a = radius of particle), for large particles. As the particles become smaller, the rate tends towards aI/a dependence, and eventually, with very small particles, it is independent of their size. Recently reported rates of fading of pigments of measured particle size gave results in agreement with the present treatment; the smallest particles thus considered are of the same order of magnitude as those of high light fastness direct dyes in cellulose, as observed by electron microscopy. Thus the model may be applicable to at least some water-soluble dyes as well as pigments.},

	title = {Paper – {Line} – {Light}. {The} {Preservation} of {Architectural} {Drawings} and {Photoreproductions} from the {Hans} {Scharoun} {Archive}.},
	abstract = {In a four-year project, 5000 architectural drawings and photoreproductions by Hans Scharoun (1893–1972) from the architectural archive of the Akademie der Künste, Berlin, have been subjected to a materials analysis, preserved with a new treatment method, and digitized. The collection comprises plans on 138 important construction projects by Scharoun, such as the Berlin Philharmonie. The book presents the results of the analyses and the methods applied in a clear and detailed manner. The main focuses of the conception were on minimizing the conservation treatments carried out on the plans, which had been damaged through storage and use, and on developing a new system for rehousing them. In particular, the methods for flattening the rolled, large-format plans, and for mending tears in tracing paper, were adapted to fit the special technological features of architectural plans. The book is accompanied by video documentation on DVD, illustrating the application of the techniques. A particular focus of the project was the technological analysis of the photoreproductions. The Hans Scharoun archive mainly contains diazotypes, but also ferrogallic prints, gel lithographs, and silver gelatine contact prints. History, technology, related processes and characteristic identifying features are described and explained using macroscopic and microscopic illustrations. The accompanying plate of illustrations reproduces the documentation in summarized form and facilitates identification of photoreproductive techniques on the actual object. The project was a cooperation of the Akademie der Künste, Berlin, with the Program in the Conservation of Works of Art on Paper, Archives- and Library Materials of the Stuttgart State Academy of Art and Design and the Museum of Architecture of the Technische Universität Berlin. It was funded within the framework of the KUR-Program (Program for the Conservation of Moveable Cultural Assets) of the Federal Cultural Foundation and the Foundation of German States and supported by the Gesellschaft der Freunde der Akademie der Künste.},

Starting from the qualitative observation, we have attempted to quantify the pigments colour variations induced by grinding and then attributable to granularity. Powdered pigments of principal colours have been selected in specific particle size range by mechanical sieving. The measurements were performed both on pigment pellets and on paintings realized with binder casein. All samples were characterized by an optical and colorimetric point of view through spectrophotometric analysis and for the surface morphological observation through scanning electron microscopy.},

Pigments are colored, colorless, or fluorescent particulate organic or inorganic finely divided solids which are usually insoluble in, and essentially chemically unaffected by, the vehicle or medium in which they are incorporated. On the other hand, the color, which is highly dependent on the chemical and physical properties of a matter, is a result of the interaction between light and substance.

This formula has its drawback and a number of other color differencing formulas have been issued that try to accommodate how the human observer perceives color differencing in different areas of the color space. Trained and untrained observers in regards to judging color differences were asked to rank color differences of test colors. In both cases the ΔE2000 formula corresponded best with the way both groups of observers perceived these color differences. When industry experts were asked to rank perceived color differences without having a standard to compare to the CMC1:1 formula corresponds well with their observations. Although the ΔE2000 is mathematically more complicated than the ΔEab formula the TC130 is mentioning guideline values (not official standard values) for evaluating process colors in the ISO 12646-2 procedure in its latest draft version. This is an indication that the ΔE2000 formula will soon become the standard color differencing equation and replace the ΔEab formula.},

The specimen of mineral fibre insulation was placed between a space with controlled temperature and relative humidity and a space with a controlled, higher temperature, and a measured but not controlled relative humidity (RH). This assembly was allowed to reach equilibrium with no vapour movement between the spaces, as tested by a constant RH on each side and by zero flux of water vapour measured in the cold side chamber. The RH and temperature values were converted to partial vapour pressure and to vapour concentration in g/m 3 . The concentrations proved to be more equal on either side of the specimen than the partial vapour pressures. This supports an argument that it is concentration difference that drives diffusion of gases. Isothermal diffusion cannot be tested experimentally in this way, but it is reasonable to assume that concentration is the driving potential. The close equality of the concentrations makes it unnecessary to invoke temperature difference as a third possible potential for driving diffusion.},

This paper describes an alternative approach based on an interdisciplinary study of psychology literature. Heuristics such as ‘take the best’, ‘elimination by aspects’ and ‘satisficing’ are discussed with their application to conservation situations. When faced with a complex problem and a lack of data, conservators may be able to improve the quality and efficacy of their decision-making for collections care by placing a greater emphasis on criteria selection and prioritisation over data collection.},

	abstract = {This paper takes the study of Van Gogh’s Paris picture supports (canvases, cartons and priming layers) as a common theme of investigation. The topic was examined from different angles, reflecting the multidisciplinary approach of the De Mayerne Programme. Dr. Stéphanie Constantin conducted a detailed search for documentary and archival information in Paris relating to the manufacture and retail of artist materials in late nineteenth century France, with a focus on Van Gogh’s suppliers. Put together with evidence derived from the technical examinations of his Paris paintings, these documentary findings helped to reconstruct the artist’s working practice in the period. All of the listed colormen he used are known to have supplied other Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters too, making it probable that Van Gogh used some of the very same materials as his contemporaries. Beatrice Marino at AMOLF conducted an in-depth imaging analytical study of ground/paint samples from a group of Paris pictures painted on ready-primed carton supports with a broader aim was to develop quantitative techniques for comparing and classifying paint cross-sections. Within the HART project led by Dr. Leslie Carlyle, precise reconstructions of a selection of Van Gogh’s prepared picture supports and paints were made. Some Paris examples illustrate how these help to understand the working properties and visual consequences of using these materials.},

These recommendations are outlined in this paper. Central to the Forum recommendations is the responsibility of conservation science to provide benefit through research and innovation. This relies on shared strategic vision and good governance, to identify priority needs and align efforts accordingly. To enhance the effectiveness of conservation science research, it is imperative to adopt an approach based on needs assessment, collaboration, and sharing. However, to establish whether desired goals are being met, systematic assessment of what is delivered and how it is used is required. Evaluation tools provide a structured way to identify needs and to measure results, offering a basis for learning and improvement. A new initiative is outlined, launched by ICCROM in follow-up to the Forum, to develop a common framework for needs and outcome assessment for heritage conservation science. To achieve this will require participation and support at multiple levels, and collaboration is called for to continue and sustain this effort.},

Together with art historian Joseph Armstrong Baird, Jr. (1922–1992), Muskavitch launched the Laboratory for Research in the Fine Arts and Museology in July 1964 as a West Coast counterpart to the Intermuseum Laboratory at Oberlin and the Conservation Center at New York University. As the first university-based conservation program in the Western United States, it treated artworks from throughout California and intended to offer a 2-year diploma in conservation to art history graduate students. From the beginning, undergraduates were also involved in its activities. However, the graduate diploma was never introduced and Muskavitch retired in 1971. The Laboratory closed seven years later, after the departure of its second director, Gerald R. Hoepfner. Drawing upon unpublished archives and interviews, this article investigates the origins, development, and dissolution of the Laboratory. It concludes that its failure was due to complex institutional politics and a perception of theoretical divergence from the art history program, rather than merely the result of ongoing budget cuts.},

Thus, equivalent exposure doses obtained by using either high-illuminance levels for short periods of time or lower illumination for longer exhibition periods are believed to cause similar degrees of damage to an object. Microfading spectrometry permitted the investigation of this phenomenon by evaluation of light-induced changes in a series of samples. The effects of equivalent exposure doses on materials such as Blue Wool 1, LightCheck Ultra, and various dyed silks from a reference collection were compared. The results indicate that reciprocity is obeyed by the most stable colorants, while materials with lower stability to light may experience deviations that are proportional to the intensity of illumination. This study confirms that reciprocity failure is associated with the use of high-intensity lamps during accelerated-aging trials. Therefore only those tests conducted at low-illumination intensity ranges where reciprocity holds should be employed when one estimates the extent of damage occurring in a museum environment.},

	title = {A study on the action of light on objects of cultural interest by evaluating the light levels in the museum and performing micro-fading tests of materials},
	abstract = {Light is considered the most complex environmental parameter associated to the deterioration of museum collections. The high illumination levels sometimes required for appreciating a work of art may cause irreversible damage to its materials. The capacity of individual materials to absorb or reflect light needs to be determined since the extent of deterioration will depend on the chemical and physical nature of each object. Light-sensitive materials frequently found in museum collections generally include textiles, documents and works of art on paper. The complexity of the damaging effects of light to museum collections has caused an increase in the number of institutions interested in studying these phenomena over the past few years. This PhD thesis was focused in studying the effects of light on materials found in museum collections from macroscopic and microscopic points of view. The fading caused by intense light levels incident on the surface of an object can be detected by the naked eye. These degradation effects can also be identified and quantified at a microscopic level by using analytical methods. This study provided the opportunity of using a recently renovated museum as a space for field work in order to quantify and understand the behavior of light in its exhibition spaces. The building selected for the present study was the Old Patent Office Building in Washington, DC. The building, now called the Donald W. Reynolds Center (DWRC) for American Art and Portraiture, has undergone a six-year renovation and was reopened to the public in 2006. The space is shared between two museums: the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery. This PhD thesis covers two major research areas. First, a light levels assessment of several exhibition spaces in the museum previously mentioned. Second, a technical study on the fading of materials found in a variety of laboratory samples and museum objects. The study has demonstrated the need for assessing the light levels in a museum and determining the amount of damage that light is capable of inducing in cultural heritage objects prior to the establishment of new exhibition guidelines},

Some of the paintings belonging to this group are exposed to environmental factors including natural daylight, wind and rain, depending on the time of the day and the season of the year. Therefore, their preservation is a major concern to stakeholders and researchers responsible for protecting and studying these prehistoric paintings. The experimental work in Cova Remigia focused on measuring the reflectance curves (400-700 nm) and determining the photostability of various areas containing red and black pigments on the rock art paintings. The preliminary results indicate that MFS is a suitable technique for studying the response to light of rock/pigment systems found in rock art sites.

The use of micro-fade testing as an alternative way of conducting light-fastness assessments of dye/textile systems has been explored.

This work was designed as a feasibility study on the use of a micro-fading tester as a non-contact and non-destructive technique to evaluate the light-stability of materials present in ethnographic collections. A broad range of objects containing a wide variety of materials were selected for the study. The materials investigated included a variety of dyes applied on silk, cotton, and wool substrates along with some unusual materials such as tanned skin and seal gut skin. The results from this investigation have allowed establishing exhibition recommendations taking into consideration the sensitivity of each object, light levels in the museum building, and estimated light exposures based on the duration of the exhibit. The micro-fading tester has proven to be a very useful tool for determining the light-stability of ethnographic materials without causing any harm to the objects. Objects containing equivalent materials are usually classified under a general category based on their probable sensitivity to light. However, micro-fading test results have permitted the detection of dissimilarities among some of these objects which could be associated to variations in prior fading histories, the quality of raw materials, and different preparation methods.},

He examines the development and uses of the different materials and tools of papermaking: the different types of hand molds, such as the "wove" mold and the "laid" mold of China; methods of maceration (beating the cloth); of dipping the molds or pouring the liquid pulp over the molds; and of pressing, drying, and sizing the paper. He also compares papermaking techniques, including old and new methods of making paper by hand and machine-made paper, and he discusses early and modern watermarking styles and processes. Over 320 illustrations show actual pages from rare books and scrolls from every corner of the world, scenes of past and present-day papermaking, tools, materials, and watermarks. A two-page map traces the 1,000-year journey of papermaking from China to Europe, and a chronology of paper and paper-related developments spans over 4,500 years. Dard Hunter (1883 1966) is still recognized as the world's foremost authority on paper and papermaking. This is the classic work on papermaking, used as a text and reference in classrooms, museums and libraries.

These experiments are useful in preparing for future imaging that will result in hardcopy that will yield the least metameric matches to the original colors. The approach evaluated consisted of capturing scenes through a trichromatic digital camera combined with multiple filterings and six-color printing. The system was designed to estimate the original scene spectra on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The spectral-based printing used in this research was able to produce the least metameric reproduction to the original.

The theoretical results are compared with those obtained experimentally for various commonly used colorants and substrates. The results predicted by the model generally show good agreement with experimental results, but in some cases departures are found. The model has been modified in these specific cases by taking into account non-uniformities in the layer of colorant. The model provides a simple method for evaluating effective quantum yields as bench mark measures for the light fading of layers of colorants. It enables the prediction of light fading characteristics from measurements carried out over a short time span. The limitations of the model are also considered.},

	abstract = {Long-term display of works of art on paper is problematic, and installation of oversize works of art can be challenging. However, a joint project between the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology and the Intermuseum Conservation Association successfully achieved both. This paper describes the treatment of twenty one oversize watercolors, and their subsequent installation in a setting that can function as both display venue and long-term storage. The watercolors, the largest of which measures nearly twenty feet long, presented challenges not only because of their extraordinary size, but also because of their hybrid nature; they were painted on paper backed with canvas. Because of their large size, many of the works were stored rolled, and were thus inaccessible to students and visitors. The treatment involved surface cleaning, humidification, flattening, and hinging of the watercolors to aluminum honeycomb panels. Although much of the treatment drew on techniques commonly used in paper conservation, it successfully combined methodology and materials from both paintings and paper conservation. Micro-fading tests of the watercolor pigments were used to design display lighting, and a simple cleat system was used to hang the panels. The project was funded in part by a Conservation Project Support Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.},

The authors' use of precise spectrophotometric reflectance measurements and modern color-matching computations based on the Kubelka-Munk theory have made it possible to demonstrate that the decrease in concentration of alizarin lake (fading) during exposure in a Fade-ometer follows first-order kinetics. The traditional artists' colorant, alizarin lake, was used as a model of a fugitive organic pigment in mixture with a scattering white pigment, titanium dioxide, applied in a poly(vinyl acetate)-based paint at complete hiding. The experimental results indicate that the red-colored alizarin lake tends to be converted to a yellow form which in turn fades to a colorless condition, also by first-order kinetics. The specific rate of fading is shown to be essentially constant over a wide range of initial concentrations of colorant and of pigment volume concentration.},

Because of their solubility in water, arsenic oxides readily migrate and are found throughout the multi-layered paint system. The widespread arsenic migration has consequences for conservation, and this paper provides better insight into the extent of the problem. Five paint samples containing orpiment, realgar or emerald green pigments deriving from paintings by De Heem (17th C), Van Gogh (19th C), Rousseau (19th C), an unknown 17th C northern European artist and an Austrian painted cupboard (19th C) were investigated using SEM/EDX, imaging ATR-FTIR and arsenic (As) K–edge μ-XANES to obtain the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of arsenic in the paint system. In all of the samples investigated arsenic had migrated throughout the multi-layered paint structure of the art object, from support to varnish. Furthermore, As5+-species were found throughout the entire paint sample. We hypothesize that arsenic trioxide is first formed, dissolves in water, further oxidizes to arsenic pentaoxide, and then reacts with lead, calcium and other ions and is deposited in the paint system as insoluble arsenates. Since the degradation of arsenic pigments such as orpiment, realgar and emerald green occurs through a highly mobile intermediate stage, it not only affects the regions rich in arsenic pigments, but also the entire object, including substrate and top varnish layers. Because of this widespread potential for damage, preventing degradation of arsenic pigments should be prioritized and conservators should minimize exposure of objects containing arsenic pigments to strong light, large fluctuations in relative humidity and water-based cleaning agents.},

Que cet architecte, « parisien » entre tous, ait été de nationalité allemande n'est sans doute pas étranger à la relative discrétion dans laquelle son oeuvre fut longtemps tenue. L'hostilité délibérée d'Haussmann y est certainement, aussi, pour quelque chose. Ajoutons que l'irréparable perte d'une grande partie des archives d'Hittorff a considérablement entravé les recherches réalisées autour de cette carrière exceptionnelle. C'est néanmoins cet architecte méconnu qui - de 1810 jusqu'à la fin de sa vie - redessine le coeur de Paris, imaginant l'une des plus belles perspectives de l'urbanisme européen : sous la monarchie de Juillet puis sous le Second Empire, il réalise et aménage l'axe superbe qui s'élance de la place de la Concorde aux Champs-Elysées pour rejoindre la place de l'Étoile et se poursuivre jusqu'au bois de Boulogne. Auteur de nombreux édifices parisiens, dont la gare du Nord, Hittorff s'est également fait remarquer de ses contemporains par sa fameuse théorie sur la polychromie dans l'architecture grecque. Théorie qu'il a mise en pratique dans plusieurs de ses réalisations parisiennes comme l'on peut en juger, de nos jours, par deux monuments dont les façades restaurées ont retrouvé leurs couleurs d'origine : le Cirque d'hiver et l'église Saint-Vincerit-de-Paul. Cet ouvrage - qui comporte un catalogue complet de l'oeuvre d'Hittorff - invite le lecteur à revisiter Paris à travers les réalisations de l'architecte colonais.},

Although much attention has been devoted to the modeling of aging and weathering phenomena over the last decade, comparatively little attention has been paid to fading effects. In this article, we present a theoretical frame work for the physically based simulation of time-dependent spectral changes induced by absorbed radiation. This framework relies on the general volumetric radiative transfer theory, and it employs a physicochemical approach to account for variations in the absorptive properties of colorants. Employing this framework, a layered fading model that can be readily integrated into existing rendering systems is developed using the Kubelka-Munk theory. We evaluate its correctness through comparisons of measured and simulated fading results. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this model through renderings depicting typical fading scenarios.},

The presence of white pigments as an extender contributes to the permanence of the coloured paint film. Samples of Prussian blue paint films from 18th- and 19th-century paint films were studied. Samples from paintings are compared to samples prepared in the laboratory. Differences between these samples are discussed. Experimental procedures studied colour change in samples of Prussian blue- and lead white-containing paint films in cold-pressed linseed oil and watercolour media exposed to light. Reversible colour change and redox reactions are addressed. The difference in paint media did not have an effect on the degree of colour change. It is noted that the presence of alumina as an extender in paint films increased the rate of fading when paint films were exposed to light. The mixtures of Prussian blue and white pigment had an increased effect on the colour change of the paint film when compared to paint films pigmented with Prussian blue alone.},

	abstract = {In earlier articles, we determined the spatial distributions and concentrations of all pigments used by Van Gogh in his painting Field with Irises near Arles. The colors of some pigments are expected to have changed over time, especially those of chrome yellow, cochineal, and eosin lake. For all pigments in this painting, we made physical paint reconstructions by following historical sources on raw materials and production processes, and we determined their optical properties. We combined this with pigment concentration maps to reconstruct the original colors of the painting digitally. When substituting the reconstruction paints into the calculations, we found that technical-scientific data was not sufficient to resolve several issues. In those cases, discussions within the broad interdisciplinary team allowed us to make informed decisions. These issues refer to the representation of the sky area, and the original contributions of the red lake pigments to local colors. The digitally reconstructed colors of the painting show that due to discoloring of red lake pigments, the irises in the field have changed from a warm purple to purplish blue, and many pink spots in the field have turned to white. The range of yellows in the field has decreased and partly turned to dark brown. The digital reconstruction gives a better understanding of the color scheme used by Van Gogh when compared to remarks the artist made in letters when describing this painting. Also, the original color composition is seen to be aligned with color theories on which Van Gogh based his work.},

	abstract = {Colors in many paintings of great art historical value have changed over time, due to the combined effects of natural ageing, accumulated surface grime, and materials added during later conservation treatments. The physical restoration of the colors in such paintings is not possible. This article describes one part of work done to digitally restore the colors of Van Gogh's painting Field with Irises near Arles, dating from May 1888. We have used multispectral reflectance data to estimate absorption K and backscattering S parameters of Kubelka‐Munk 2‐constant theory. This was done for all 13 pigments known to have been used by Van Gogh in this painting, and based on this the concentration maps for each of these pigments were calculated. We validated the calculated concentration maps in several ways. For some pigments, we were able to predict spots on the painting where the pigment is expected to occur in unmixed form based on visual examination. For several other pigments, the concentration maps could be shown to agree with XRF data. Finally, for some other pigments the concentration maps were supported by additional evidence from microscopic examinations, remarks in Van Gogh's letters and from early color reproductions. For the 1.7 million pixels for which multispectral data is available, the average color difference between the calculated and measured spectral reflectance curves is CIEDE2000 = 1.05. This further confirms that the Kubelka‐Munk calculations are well suited to describe the variety of spectral reflectance on the painting.},

	abstract = {Varnish layers applied to paintings often discolor as they age, upsetting the original colour relationships intended by the artist. The removal of aged varnish layers using physical and chemical means is a highly skilled and often time‐consuming operation, which is not lightly undertaken. There are many aspects under consideration before embarking upon such treatment, including the visual result inferred by spot cleaning tests. In this article, we develop a technique for digital removal of discolored varnish that can help to envisage how a painting will look following cleaning treatment. The digital technique was applied to Vincent van Gogh's painting Field with Irises near Arles (May 1888), in parallel to the painting actually being cleaned, which allowed direct validation of the method developed. In the new method, we utilized not only hyperspectral data from parts of the painting with and without the varnish, but also experts' identification of spots on the painting where unmixed white pigment has been applied. The physical model that we use is based on Kubelka‐Munk two‐constant theory, commonly used to model the optical properties of paint. We show that with this model it is possible to determine the transmittance and reflectance of the varnish layer as function of wavelength. Results from previous studies confirm the calculated values. With the new method, we created a high‐resolution digital image of the painting, as it would look after varnish removal, at a moment when the actual varnish was still present on the painting. The new method may help conservators and others involved in decisions made regarding issues of varnish removal from paintings, or may help to visualize the colors of a painting without discolored varnish in cases where its physical removal cannot be safely accomplished and so is not an option.},

The performance of instruments such as microscopes, telescopes, and the human eye depends on the principles of optics. But even with recent technological advances, some mysteries remain. The nature of light has puzzled scientists for centuries, and just when they think they have it figured out, light does something completely unpredictable. ""Light and Optics"" explores the science of electromagnetic radiation and its tremendous variety of applications. This enlightening book includes discussions of the optics of image formation, the intense beams produced by lasers, the role of light in biological processes such as photosynthesis and medical procedures such as laser surgery, astronomical observations based on all types of radiation, and applications involving communication, radar, and the transformation of light into electricity.},

This paper reviews information on the manifestations of pigment influences on polymer stability and on their underlying causes. It aims to provide some understanding of the complex phenomena, identify possible causes of unfavourable pigment effects on polymer light stability, and provide some direction for improving the light stability of polymer-pigment-stabiliser systems of unfavourable performance. Favourable pigment influences on polymer light stability may be due to screening of harmful radiation, selective absorption of harmful radiation, and deactivation of polymer photoexcited species. Negative influences may be due to initiation of polymer photo-oxidation by photoexcited pigment chromophores, adsorption or chemical transformation of stabilising additives, influence on polymer morphology, or sensitisation of singlet oxygen formation. Pigment-polymer-stabiliser interactions are complex. Much work is needed to understand them better. A special challenge is a better understanding of why some orange, yellow, and red organic pigments exhibit negative influences on pigment light stability.},

	title = {Paper and board in closed boxes : alteration of water sorption capacity during cyclic temperature changes},
	volume = {28},
	abstract = {The role of temperature fluctuations on the water sorption capacity of the paper materials stored inside a closed solander box is explored. Two boxes of the same kind were filled with either a stack of corrugated board mounts or mat board mounts. The boxes were subjected to cyclic temperature changes between 28 and 56°C. The water sorption capacity of the boards overall gradually decreased over time, as did the amplitude of the absorption-desorption curve that occurred with each temperature change. The reduced water absorption capacity of the paper materials is assumed to be caused by an increase in density experienced by cellulose during wetting-drying cycles. While this was true for the different inserted materials, small differences were observed between them. 

L'étude porte sur l'influence de fluctuation de températures externes sur la capacité de sorption d'eau de matériel papier et carton placés dans des boîtes Solander. Pour faire cette étude on avait emboîté du papier, des enveloppes carton et du carton ondulé dans trois boîtes de structures similaires. Ces boîtes ont été placées dans une chambre climatisée pour y être soumises à des fluctuations cycliques de températures allant de 28 à 56° C, un cycle complet durant trois heures. La capacité de sorption d'eau du matériel a été indirectement influencée par la mesure de l'humidité dans l'espace d'air entre l'empilement des des boîtes. Les mesures effectuées ont montré qu'il y avait une baisse de la capacité de sorption d'eau selon la durée du traitement. Ceci ressort de la baisse de l'amplitude de la courbe d'humidité qui traduit la perte d'eau lors du réchauffement et le gain en eau lors du refroidissement du matériel placé en emboîtage. La réduction observée de capacité d'absorption d'eau peut être due à une compression des fibres de cellulose suite à une répétition de phases d'humidification et d'asséchement, on note à ce propos peu de différences notables dans les réactions des matériaux soumis à ce traitement. 

Der Einfluss von externen Temperaturschwankungen auf das Sorptionsvermögen von Papier und Kartonmaterialen gegenüber Wasser in geschlossenen Solanderboxen wird gemessen. Für das Experiment wurden Passepartouts aus Wellkarton oder Passepartoutkarton im Stapel in baugleiche Solanderboxen eingeschlossen. Die geschlossenen Boxen wurden in einer Klimakammer einem zyklischen Temperaturwechsel zwischen 28 und 56°C. Die Wasseraufnahmekapazität der Materialien wurde indirekt durch Messung der relativen Feuchte im Luftraum innerhalb der Stapel bestimmt. Die Messungen zeigen, dass das Wassersorptionsvermögen aller Materialien mit der Behandlungsdauer abnimmt. Das geht aus der Verkleinerung der Amplitude der Feuchtigkeitskurve hervor, die Wasserabgabe bei Erwärmung und Wasseraufnahme bei Abkühlung der eingeschlossenen Materialien widerspiegelt. Die beobachtete reduzierte Wasseraufnahmefähigkeit kann auf eine Verdichtung der Cellulosefasern als Folge der häufigen Wiederholung von Befeuchtung und Trocknung, zurückgeführt werden, wobei die verschieden Materialien sich nur geringfügig in ihrem Verhalten unterscheiden.},

Laser radiation as a non-contact tool offers prospects for that purpose. For the studies presented here, paper model samples were prepared using three different paper types (pure cellulose, rag paper, and wood-pulp paper). Pure cellulose serves as reference material. Rag and wood-pulp paper represent essential characteristics of the basic materials of real-world artworks. The papers were mechanically soiled employing pulverized charcoal. Pure and artificially soiled paper samples were treated with laser pulses of 28 fs (800 nm wavelength) and 8–12 ns (532 nm) duration in a multi pulse approach. Additionally, the cellulose reference material was processed with 30 ps (532 nm) laser pulses. Damage and cleaning thresholds of pure and soiled paper were determined for the different laser regimes. Laser working ranges allowing for removal of contamination and avoiding permanent modification to the substrate were found. The specimens prior and after laser illumination were characterized by light-optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as multi spectral imaging analysis. The work extends previous nanosecond laser cleaning investigations on paper into the ultra-short pulse duration domain.},

Multi shot experiments with low-energy pulses were compared with single pulse investigations utilizing high pulse energies achieving a constant energy load incident on the samples in both cases. The cleaning efficiency and possible yellowing effects were evaluated by means of a multi spectral imaging system. An extensive microscopic analysis of the cleaned parts of the samples provided insight into the remaining soiling on the surface and in the bulk of the paper material after laser treatment.

This compilation includes chemical actinometers for the gas, solid, microheterogeneous, and liquid phases, as well as for the use with pulsed lasers for the measurement of transient absorbances, including the quantum yield of phototransformation, as well as the literature for each of the actinometers. The actinometers listed are for the use in the wavelength range from the UV to the red region of the spectrum. A set of recommended standard procedures is also given. Advantages and disadvantages are discussed regarding the use of chemical actinometers vs. electronic devices for the measurement of the number of photons absorbed.

Sheet t emperature was kept near 300 C during irradiation, through contact with a thermostated metal backing, thereby eliminating heat effects, shown otherwise to overshadow light effects, using intense sources. In consequence, the results differed from those of previous workers. Yellowing of papers (without lignin) commonly ascribed to light was found to result from heat or age, but not light ; papers bleached when heat effects were eliminated during irradiation. Even lignified paper was bleached by light in nitrogen. Paper scorched brown at high temperatures or yellowed at 1000 C, and yellow papers 250 years old were bleached by light. Lack of oxygen inhibits but does not altogether prevent photochemical deterioration. The role of water vapor differs fundamentally for cotton and wood-pulp paper. Lignified paper is very unstable to light. Printers' ink extensively protects paper. Irradiated papers are subsequently less stable in the dark than those not previously irradiated. The order of photochemical stability of papers was as .follows: new-rag, refined sulfite, old-rag, soda-s ulfite, and newsprint. The light stability of new-rag papers was greatly affected by acid and rosin, whereas that of old-rag and sodasulfite was only slightly affected, in contrast to heat stability, for which pH is important for all fibers. Newsprint, made neutral with NaHC03, showed a large increase in light stability. Rosin did not seriously affect t he stability of any papers as long .as t heir acidity was low.},

At that time knowledge of climatic conditions in museums was tacit and based on personal experience ratherthan on scientific studies. However, in the early twentieth century the problem of managing museum climate increased as curatorsbecame more aware of the dehydrating effects of central heating on panels and polychrome wood. The first successful attemptsto automatically control indoor climate were carried out at Gripsholm in the 1920s. The focus was then on monitoring andcontrolling temperature rather than relative humidity, but these early attempts also showed that extreme levels of humidity couldbe avoided in an environment that had never been designed for permanent heating.

The use of a high efficiency beveled-tip fiber optic probe and a pulsed xenon source gives improved detection efficiency and minimizes the interference from ambient light, eliminating the need to shield the analyzed area and allowing non-contact, non-invasive analysis. Thin washes of organic colorants, often impossible to sample, are ideally suited to this kind of analysis. This study describes the in situ identification of indigo, Prussian blue and a red insect dye (cochineal carmine or lac dye) in two paintings by Katsushika Hokusai. /// La spectroscopie de rï¿½flectance UV-visible est une technique rapide et prï¿½cise pour l'ï¿½tude des surfaces peintes.

	abstract = {In this work a novel micro-fading instrument has been developed that has increased structural stability, hence increasing the portability over previously reported instruments of this type. Using this instrument several new experimental methods have been developed and applied for the investigation of the photosensitivity of painted samples and coloured works of art (with particular focus on the effects of anoxic housing). The colour fading and reversion behaviour of a traditional Prussian blue pigment ground in gum Arabic was investigated for the first time in 0\%, 2\%, 3.5\%, 5\%, 10\% or 21\% oxygen concentrations. Results from this investigation indicated that the previously reported deleterious effects of reduced oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) for Prussian blue may only become relevant at oxygen lower levels (beginning at an hypoxic oxygen level above 2\% and below 3.5\%). An extension of the investigation to a large sample set of Prussian blues indicated that relatively low concentrations of oxygen (around 5\%) may be tolerated by Prussian-blue containing works of art. The novel investigation of the effect of reduced oxygen housing using the microfading technique was extended to a very large varied sample set of traditional watercolour pigments ground in gum Arabic. This new avenue of investigation for the conservation of art work produced encouraging results to overcoming some of the problems of anoxic storage for a wider variety of watercolour pigments. This broad investigation also led to a better understanding of how much light exposure, in and out anoxia, is permissible for different types of watercolour pigments. Incorporating a linear variable filter into the design enabled the investigation of the wavelength dependence of fading of many samples to a greater degree of resolution than had previously been attempted. The wavelength dependence of fading for the samples tested was found to correlate well with the absorption spectra although an exception was found when testing a sample of Prussian blue pigment, where the degree of fading decreased with the wavelength of incident radiation.},

	abstract = {An investigation for light exposure on pigments in low-oxygen environments (in the range 0–5\% oxygen) was conducted using a purpose-built automated microfadometer for a large sample set including multiple samples of traditional watercolour pigments from nineteenth-century and twentieth-century sources, selected for concerns over their stability in anoxia. The pigments were prepared for usage in watercolour painting: ground and mixed in gum Arabic and applied to historically accurate gelatine glue-sized cotton and linen-based papers. Anoxia benefited many colorants and no colorant fared worse in anoxia than in air, with the exception of Prussian blue and Prussian green (which contains Prussian blue). A Prussian blue sampled from the studio materials of J.M.W. Turner (1775 − 1851) was microfaded in different environments (normal air (20.9\% oxygen) 0, 1, 2, 3.5, or 5\% oxygen in nitrogen) and the subsequent dark behaviour was measured. The behaviour of the sample (in normal air, anoxia, and 5\% oxygen in nitrogen) proved to be consistent with the 55 separately sourced Prussian blue samples. When exposed to light in 5\% oxygen in nitrogen, Prussian blue demonstrated the same light stability as in air (at approximately 21°C and 1 atmosphere). Storage in 5\% oxygen is proposed for ‘anoxic’ display of paper-based artworks that might contain Prussian blue, to protect this material while reducing light-induced damage to other components of a watercolour, including organic colorants and the paper support.},

By focusing an intense beam of light to a tiny submillimetre sized spot and simultaneously monitoring the colour change over time, the fading rate of the material can be measured without producing noticeable damage. The increased intensity of light allows rapid determination of light-fastness of materials. This paper examines an improved design of microfading spectrometer that is easy to assemble, compact, robust, capable of fully automatic acquisition of data with precision control of the fading time to produce higher precision measurements and to allow simultaneous monitoring of colour, spectral reflectance and other changes in real time. The effects of various parameters such as thickness and concentration of paint layer, the binding medium and substrate on the fading rates are examined for selected pigments and found that in certain cases substrates, binding media and thickness can affect the fading rate. Reciprocity in the context of microfading compared with realistic exhibition conditions is examined and found that it breaks down for some pigments.},

Subjective assessments were made using semantic differential scales and the results were analysed using factor analysis techniques.

	abstract = {The impact of the spectral composition of light on the discoloration of paint pigments has been investigated for the case of lead chromate sulfate, an unstable yellow pigment used by Vincent van Gogh and other painters. With LEDification, museum lighting is moving from using halogen to LED lamps. LED light sources have a significantly different spectral composition than halogen lamps. To understand the impact of these differences on pigment stability, the wavelength dependence of pigment discoloration was determined. Contrary to the expectation that lower wavelength photons induce more damage than higher wavelength ones, UV (394 nm), blue, and cyan light all lead to similar levels of discoloration of a pigment for the same level of radiant power. By understanding this wavelength dependence, it becomes possible to create white light LED lamps with a spectral composition tuned to minimize the degradation effect. An existing LED solution with a modified emission indeed resulted in 30\% less color change in the experiment than halogen. Furthermore, a method is proposed to optimize the LED spectra by tuning to the properties of each specific artifact. Simulations show that this can reduce the damage of the light source by 45\% in specific cases.},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Summary After considering the notions of technology, art and culture, this essay presents a brief study on the metaphysical concept of beauty referring particularly to the thought of Thomas Aquinas and then proposing its application in an anthropological-pedagogical sphere. Focus then moves onto the philosophical concept of “conservation”. In this way the paper intends to show how Christian thought has necessarily deepened – in the light of the fundamental notions that belong to it – both the meaning of beauty, the artistic one included, and the concept of conservation and how these perspectives can represent in some way an interesting contribution for those who work in the field of conservation sciences or in the field of the planning and promotion of artistic and cultural events, especially if these events relate to religious heritage. Résumé Après avoir évoqué des notions de technique, d’art et de culture, le texte présente une courte étude sur le concept métaphysique de beauté en se référant principalement à la pensée de Thomas d’Aquin, puis en proposant des applications d’ordre anthropologique/pédagogique. L’attention se tourne ensuite vers le concept philosophique de « conservation ». De cette manière, l’article se propose de montrer qu’à la lumière des notions fondamentales qui lui appartiennent, la pensée chrétienne a nécessairement approfondi la signification de la beauté - y compris de la beauté artistique - de même que le concept de conservation, et que ces perspectives peuvent représenter de quelque manière un apport intéressant pour les personnes qui travaillent dans les sciences de la conservation, ou dans la conception et la promotion d’événements artistiques et culturels, surtout s’ils concernent des biens du patrimoine religieux. Zusammenfassung Nachdem die Begriffe Technik, Kunst und Kultur in Betracht gezogen wurden, präsentiert der Test eine kurze Studie über das metaphysische Konzept der Schönheit, wobei besonders auf den Gedanken von Thomas von Aquin Bezug genommen und dann einige anthropologisch-pädagogische Anwendungen desselben vorgeschlagen werden. Die Aufmerksamkeit wendet sich dann dem philosophischen Konzept der „Bewahrung“ zu. Auf diese Weise will dieser Artikel nachweisen, dass der christliche Gedanke notwendigerweise – im Licht der ihm zugehörigen Grundbegriffe – sowohl die Bedeutung von Schönheit, einschließlich der künstlerischen, als auch das Konzept der Bewahrung eingehend untersucht hat, und dass diese Perspektiven in gewisser Weise einen interessanten Beitrag für diejenigen darstellen können, die im Bereich der „Konservierungs“-Wissenschaften oder in der Planung und Förderung künstlerischer und kultureller Veranstaltungen tätig sind, speziell wenn sie religiöse Güter betreffen.},

	abstract = {There is a general lack of knowledge concerning the materials and techniques applied by Van Gogh and his direct contemporaries. Substantial holdings of Van Gogh's work are kept in the Netherlands, providing a unique opportunity for in-depth study of a major late nineteenth-century artist and creating links to other painters of the period. Surprisingly little is known on the formulation of his commercially prepared paints in terms of pigments, binders, driers, stabilisers and extenders. Further, it is not known whether the painter added own materials to adjust the working properties of his tube paints. Advanced and established analytical techniques will be applied in collaboration with P4 and ICN to gain this information, using samples from selected paintings as well as surviving tube paints and a palette of the artist (Musée d'Orsay). Often the appearance of pictures by Van Gogh has been drastically altered by severe degradation of certain colour areas. Explanations will be sought for these phenomena, to help understand the current condition of his works. The relation between the composition and rheological properties of Van Gogh's paints will also be considered. How was the artist able to manipulate his materials to achieve particular painterly effects? Based on analytical findings and documentary research, historically accurate reconstructions of his paint systems will be made in collaboration with P5 to investigate this topic. New insights into the way that Van Gogh painted should bring us closer to understanding his pictures, since meaning and technique are intimately linked in his work. It is also possible that a highly specific characterisation of Van Gogh's painting materials and technique will provide useful criteria for dating and attribution.

Acceleration can be achieved by exposing polymeric materials to a high radiant flux; however, questions have arisen within the weathering community as to whether high radiant flux results can be extrapolated to in-service flux levels. Experiments designed to test this premise are called reciprocity law experiments. An extensive review has been conducted to assess the state-of-the-art of reciprocity law experiments in the photography, photoconductivity, photo-medicine, photobiology, and polymer photodegradation literatures. From this review, the Schwarzschild law (a power law generalization of the reciprocity law) appears to model adequately photoresponse vs. radiant flux for most materials and systems. A band theory model has been presented to explain variations in the Schwarzschild law coefficients and other experimental phenomena commonly associated with reciprocity experiments. Obstacles to the general acceptance of high radiant flux, laboratory-based experiments are discussed.},

	title = {Damage functions in heritage science},
	volume = {58},
	abstract = {This contribution critically examines various concepts related to damage functions in current use; it does not represent a comprehensive review, however. In heritage science, damage functions can be defined as functions of unacceptable change, dependent on agents of change. Unlike in other domains of science, the reference to unacceptable change implies that a value-based decision needs to be applied to the analytically determinable change, or dose–response function. Since there are a number of values associated with heritage, there can be a number of damage functions describing one and the same physical or chemical process of change. For practical reasons, it is thus useful to decouple the value function from the dose–response function, as the latter can be independently deduced (empirically or experimentally). While the behaviour of single materials and objects is often modelled deterministically, the probabilistic approach can be used to describe the degradation of complex structures, e.g. buildings, although not commonly in heritage research. There is a case to be made for more in-depth exploration of incremental and stochastic processes of degradation of heritage materials and structures, and the associated values, with a view towards developing more damage functions. Damage functions find use in modelling for predictive maintenance. However, predictions are associated with uncertainty due to the need for extrapolation, and this is also rarely analytically examined. Validation of modelling processes is possible using accurate methodologies of asset monitoring, which would enable an effective appraisal of preservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Traditional methods of image permanence testing have tracked changes in image appearance (changes in density, color balance, and/or Dmin stain) with densitometric endpoint criteria. Densitometric filter sets were optimized for specific colorant systems, for example, the Status A filter set to measure chromogenic photographic materials like those processed in RA-4 chemistry. Modern digital printing systems employ a wide variety of pigment or dye-based colorants with markedly different spectral properties, and some use more than cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colorants to achieve enhanced color gamut and improved continuous tone properties. Densitometry is no longer wholly appropriate because equivalent neutral densities expressed in R, G, and B density units can lead to significant deviations from visually perceptible neutral gray tones in modern imaging systems. CIELAB colorimetry eliminates this technical problem, but designing a colorimetric method and an endpoint criteria set that correlates well with visually perceived changes in pictorial image quality is not trivial.

The critical wavelength decreases as the resistance t o fading increases, being in the red when the light fastness is 1-3.

The differences between the composition of actinic radiation constituting daylight and that emitted by the enclosed carbon arc have been shown to be relatively unimportant as a possible source of gross anomalies in light fastness testing based on comparison with light fastness standards.

Micro-fade testing, a relatively novel technique, has allowed microspectroscopic detection of variations in the initial colour parameters of a sample, permitting assessment of its diverging fading rates. The method has been applied to fading data of various light-sensitive materials resulting in more consistent fading patterns. It has been demonstrated that micro-fading curves obtained for the same material are related by a constant value, which is the ratio of adjusted values of time and DE*.},

	abstract = {Color is an important component in the perception of beauty and in an artist’s original intent when creating a work. Better conservation of our cultural heritage requires detailed knowledge of artwork materials and the complex evolution they have endured over time. Organic dyes have been used from ancient times, and their characterization is a challenge that has been successfully addressed over the past few years by the development of advanced techniques, such as microspectrofluorimetry. In this Account, we describe the application of microspectrofluorimetry to the study of medieval illuminations, paint cross sections, millenary textiles, and wall paintings. In our research into color in medieval Portuguese illuminations, we chose to emphasize the importance of the experimental design and the use of microspectrofluorimetry in the context of other analytical techniques, such as microFTIR, microRaman, and micro-X-ray fluorescence (microXRF). Within this framework, we were able to unveil the full complexity of a medieval colorant and to address issues not yet explored, such as the influence of Arab, Jewish, and Christian cultures on the production and underlying technology of Portuguese illuminations. The analysis of individual pigment particles or aggregates (by excitation with an 8 μm diameter spot) in paint cross sections from works by Vincent van Gogh and Lucien Pissarro highlights the technique’s advantage of high spatial resolution. Its high spectral resolution proved to be useful not only for better characterizing the dyes used to color Andean textiles but also for detecting mixtures of relevant chromophores; the emission signals for the reds in Paracas and Nasca textiles were shown to be due to the presence of purpurin and pseudopurpurin. Finally, the complexity of the study of yellow dyes and the importance of accurate historical reproductions is addressed in a study of Asian organic colorants on historic Chinese wall paintings. Microspectrofluorimetry offers high sensitivity, selectivity, fast data acquisition, good spatial resolution, and the possibility of in-depth profiling. It has proved to be an invaluable analytical tool in identifying dyes and lake pigments in works of art. As Saint-Exupéry’s protagonist said in Le Petit Prince, “L’essentiel est invisible pour les yeux,” or “What is essential is invisible to the eye”—but it may be unveiled with kind love, a prepared mind, and a little help from microspectrofluorimetry.},

How has this situation arisen in UNESCO, an organization dedicated to fostering peace, tolerance and international co-operation? Since we now face an ever more interconnected world and our problems are more global they require solutions that traverse nation-states and require them to work effectively together. Yet any decision to act or protect, especially during conflict, inevitably leads to multi-polarity, fragmentation and impasse. Drawing on Hale and Held’s theory of gridlock that underscores the failures of multilateralism across the UN generally, I suggest that World Heritage provides a salient example. Since UNESCO relies on the consent and participation of sovereign nations, their decisions often mirror the very lowest level of ambition to prevail. Case studies are drawn from recent conflict over World Heritage sites in Mali, Syria and Crimea.},

	doi = {10.1117/12.2020648},
	abstract = {In the world of Cultural Heritage the first concern is all about Conservation of the works of art. A piece of art in bad shape is meant to deteriorate to an irreversible stage. To avoid this, quite often it's needed to go through one or more cycles of restoration to clean and consolidate the various elements of the piece. The very second concern, once the work of art is restored and in good and stable shape, is its fruition. At the end of the day why one should do all that restoration work if nobody then can access and view? Yet viewing and enjoying an artwork means that a visitor would be able to see it at its best, and this means, almost always, to have a good lighting system. Today, both restoration and fruition can greatly benefit of all the available technologies, and achieve very high level quality. The goal of this paper is the development of an exposimetric system suitable to be extremely useful as a tool for the the non invasive analysis, as well as for the lighting design and lighting systems monitoring. Many diagnosis techniques that are used before the restoration stage, require a suitable lighting system to allow to extract from the painting the maximum amount of information through the acquisition of images in the range of visible as well as UV and IR light. A standard exposimeter is for its own nature, sensitive only to the visible light, constrained by the standard photometric sensitivity curve V(lambda). A wide band exposimeter would be, on the other hand, an invaluable tool to get higher precision and to speed up multispectral wide band images acquisition, avoiding time wasting fail and try cycles to record the subject under wide spectrum conditions. The same equipment can be used to monitor the quality of the light in a expo lighting system at, for example, a museum or a gallery. The light hitting a piece of art has to allow the visitor to see and appreciate all the color shades, and to appreciate the contrast of dark and bright areas due only to the painting (and not to a jeopardized light). At the same time the light has not to arm the surface and the pigments, with for example an excess of UV, that can influence the chemical bonds, or an excess of infrared that could rise the temperature to damaging levels.},

A search for a general rule for light risk was undertaken by calculating the sum of fading across a distribution in sensitivities between ISO Blue Wool standards 1 and 8, for a range of both past and future exposures. A useful generalization does emerge for risk analysis in terms of historic exposure.},

Of all the environmental risks that affect heritage materials, light exposure is the only one that cannot be controlled without any impact on the optimal display of the exhibit.

	title = {Stratégies économiques et luttes sociales: le déclin de la papetetrie auvergnate ({XVIIIe} - milieu du {XIXe} siècle)},
	volume = {58},
	abstract = {The end of the 17th and much of the 18th centuries were marked by strong discontent and riots by workers in paper mills, especially in lower Auvergne, in Thiers and Ambert. Highly organized compared to the masters, workers tried to impose their own rules. These corporative practices remained present in the France of the early 19th century before the emergence of a new labor identity. Analysis of unpublished workers’ rules called by paper-makers “the law of the trade”, such as those for the arrondissement of Thiers during the First Empire, shows the persistence of old style corporatism whose aim was to preserve worker privileges made of acquired rights and special advantages. The “law” did not content itself with trying to limit the power of entrepreneurs, it also aimed at protecting workers from neighboring ones who were seen as rivals. National legislation, while suppressing part of these kinds of rules, was not able to stem the phenomenon. At the initiative of a master, Pierre Serve, owners attempted to organize themselves in order to propose a common policy. By examining the text of the “law of the trade” and the correspondence of the master paper-makers of Puy-de-Dôme among themselves and with the minister of manufactures and of commerce, it is possible to show the continuity of brotherhoods and the rise of an owner’s organization that was tolerated de facto by the State. At the same time, strict legislation was passed that tended to criminalize all worker’s activity that had a collective dimension. If this legislation played a role in the loss of vigor of worker action, it must be understood within the context of the decline of paper-making that modified profoundly technical and social relationships and provoked the destruction of earlier forms of labor solidarities. La fin du XVIIe siècle et le XVIIIe siècle sont émaillés de vives agitations et d’émeutes des ouvriers des moulins à papier, en particulier en basse Auvergne, à Thiers et à Ambert. Fortement organisés face à des maîtres qui ne le sont pas, ces ouvriers tentent d’imposer leurs propres règles. Ces pratiques corporatives demeurent dans la France de la première moitié du XIXe siècle, avant l’émergence d’une nouvelle identité ouvrière. La retranscription inédite de règles ouvrières appelées par les papetiers « loi du métier », comme celle de l’arrondissement de Thiers sous l’Empire, montre la persistance d’un corporatisme ancien soucieux de préserver ses privilèges, faits de situations acquises et d’avantages particuliers. La « loi » ne se borne pas à tenter de limiter le pouvoir des entrepreneurs, elle a aussi un but de protection face aux ouvriers voisins, vécus comme des concurrents. La législation, bien que réprimant en partie ces agissements, ne parvient pas à endiguer le phénomène. À l’initiative d’un maître : Pierre Serve, les patrons tentent alors de s’organiser pour proposer une réponse commune. L’étude des pratiques ouvrières et de la correspondance des maîtres papetiers du Puy-de-Dôme entre eux et avec le ministre des Manufactures et du Commerce permet de mettre en évidence la continuité d’un compagnonnage face auquel tente de se développer un embryon d’organisation patronale, tolérée de fait par l’Etat. Parallèlement, une législation répressive du travail est mise en place, préfigurant la criminalisation de toute activité ouvrière à dimension collective. Si la répression joue un rôle dans la perte de vigueur de l’action ouvrière, cette dernière doit être replacée dans un contexte de déclin de l’activité papetière, qui modifie les rapports techniques et sociaux de la fabrication et provoque la destruction des anciennes formes de solidarité ouvrière.},

Investigations by X-ray diffraction (XRD), mid-Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR), and Raman instruments (benchtop and portable) and synchrotron radiation-based micro-XRD and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy performed on oil-paint models, prepared with in-house synthesized PbCrO4 and PbCr1-xSxO4, permitted us to characterize the spectroscopic features of the various forms. On the basis of these results, an extended study has been carried out on historic paint tubes and on embedded paint microsamples taken from yellow-orange/pale yellow areas of 12 Van Gogh paintings, demonstrating that Van Gogh effectively made use of different chrome yellow types.

	abstract = {On several paintings by artists of the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th Century a darkening of the original yellow areas, painted with the chrome yellow pigment (PbCrO 4 , PbCrO 4 3 xPbSO 4 , or PbCrO 4 3 xPbO) is observed. The most famous of these are the various Sunflowers paintings Vincent van Gogh made during his career. In the first part of this work, we attempt to elucidate the degradation process of chrome yellow by studying artificially aged model samples. In view of the very thin (1-3 μm) alteration layers that are formed, high lateral resolution spectroscopic methods such as microscopic X-ray absorption near edge (μ-XANES), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μ-XRF), and electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) were employed. Some of these use synchrotron radiation (SR). Additionally, microscopic SR X-ray diffraction (SR μ-XRD), μ-Raman, and mid-FTIR spectroscopy were employed to completely characterize the samples. The formation of Cr(III) compounds at the surface of the chrome yellow paint layers is particularly observed in one aged model sample taken from a historic paint tube (ca. 1914). About two-thirds of the chromium that is present at the surface has reduced from the hexavalent to the trivalent state. The EELS and μ-XANES spectra are consistent with the presence of Cr 2 O 3 3 2H 2 O (viridian). Moreover, as demonstrated by μ-XANES, the presence of another Cr(III) compound, such as either Cr 2 (SO 4 ) 3 3 H 2 O or (CH 3 CO 2 ) 7 Cr 3 (OH) 2 [chromium(III) acetate hydroxide], is likely.},

	abstract = {The darkening of the original yellow areas painted with the chrome yellow pigment (PbCrO 4 , PbCrO 4 3 xPbSO 4 , or PbCrO 4 3 xPbO) is a phenomenon widely observed on several paintings by Vincent van Gogh, such as the famous different versions of Sunflowers. During our previous investigations on artificially aged model samples of lead chromate, we established for the first time that darkening of chrome yellow is caused by reduction of PbCrO 4 to Cr 2 O 3 3 2H 2 O (viridian green), likely accompanied by the presence of another Cr(III) compound, such as either Cr 2 (SO 4 ) 3 3 H 2 O or (CH 3 CO 2 ) 7 Cr 3 (OH) 2 [chromium(III) acetate hydroxide]. In the second part of this work, in order to demonstrate that this reduction phenomenon effectively takes place in real paintings, we study original paint samples from two paintings of V. van Gogh. As with the model samples, in view of the thin superficial alteration layers that are present, high lateral resolution spectroscopic methods that make use of synchrotron radiation (SR), such as microscopic X-ray absorption near edge (μ-XANES) and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μ-XRF) were employed. Additionally, μ-Raman and mid-FTIR analyses were carried out to completely characterize the samples. On both paint microsamples, the local presence of reduced Cr was demonstrated by means of μ-XANES point measurements. The presence of Cr(III) was revealed in specific areas, in some cases correlated to the presence of Ba(sulfate) and/or to that of aluminum silicate compounds.},

The color information collected during lightfastness measurement (as CIE L*a*b* values) with a micro-fading tester can be transformed to RGB values, and color swatches representing the original and faded colors displayed on a computer monitor. Such demonstration of the appearance changes can help to visualize the degree of color change and the precise nature of that change, which may not be simple lightening of the color but could also include hue or chroma changes. Judging the visual impact of a light-induced color change requires viewing the altered color in its context within a particular image. Digital renderings of paintings were created with Adobe Photoshop and Matlab, using a number of fugitive colors, the fading characteristics of which had been recorded with prolonged microfading tests of 100-1920 minutes in duration depending on the light dosage required for the color to no longer be changing. Based on this information describing the appearance of each of the colors as it changes with light exposure, simulations of the "virtually faded" painting were generated, representing the image appearance with incremental light exposure. Such virtually faded simulations can offer insight into the severity of particular light-induced color changes, allow targeting of crucial color areas that might warrant tracking in a color monitoring program, and inform discussions about the "end of exhibition life" of an object and appropriate exhibition rotation policies.},

	abstract = {Degradation of Japanese lacquer caused by light irradiation was examined at various wavelengths. By exposing lacquer specimens to a narrow monochromatic light band isolated from dispersed polychromatic light emitted by a Xe lamp source, the wavelength sensitivity characteristics of lacquer degradation could be determined on the basis of radiant energy. Tame-Urushi (brown) lacquer displayed peak degradation maxima at 220 and 315 nm. A broad shoulder peak was also observed in UVA. For Shu-Urushi (cinnabar) lacquer, in addition to peaks in the UVA-UVB range, a large degree of degradation was observed following exposure to light in the visible range. Ao-Urushi (green) lacquer showed similar characteristics, although it was less prone to degradation. Similarly, Shin-Urushi (black) lacquer showed little change in response to light, although UV light caused limited degradation. These results indicate that along with the damage caused by UVA and UVB, visible light in the range 510 - 650 nm may also have a significant degradation effect. Our results provide experimental evidence that Japanese lacquer responds differently to light of various wavelengths and that specific wavelengths, including visible light, can cause significant degradation.},

In an experiment carried out on a calibrated color monitor images of four abstract paintings obtained from hyperspectral data were shown to observers that were unfamiliar with the paintings. The color volume of the images could be manipulated by rotating the volume around the axis through the average (a*, b*) point for each painting in CIELAB color space. The task of the observers was to adjust the angle of rotation to produce the best subjective impression from the paintings. It was found that the distribution of angles selected for data pooled across paintings and observers could be described by a Gaussian function centered at 10o, i.e. very close to the original colors of the paintings. This result suggest that painters are able to predict well what compositions of colors observers prefer.},

The lining method followed that used by J.C. Traas for lining paintings by Van Gogh between 1926 and 1933. Visual changes in the ground samples after lining were noted and colour change was measured using a reflectance spectrophotometer. The binding medium of the ground was found to be the most significant factor, with the greatest darkening occurring in samples bound in glue, followed by emulsion and oil. The presence and the method of application of size used in the preparation of the ground samples and the inorganic composition also influenced darkening and colour change as a result of lining. Grounds on unsized canvas darkened the most, while a layer of gelled size reduced impregnation with the lining adhesive and concomitant darkening. Chalk-containing grounds darkened more than grounds containing barium sulphate or lead white. Comparisons between the reconstruction samples and wax-resin lined paintings by Van Gogh highlighted difficulties in attributing the darkening of the ground in the paintings to the lining or to other factors, such as staining by original oil binder in the paint.},

	title = {In their true colors: {Developing} new methods for recoloring faded taxidermy},
	volume = {19},
	abstract = {From 2010–11, the American Museum of Natural History completed an ambitious program of renovation to the habitat dioramas in the Hall of North American Mammals. Created in the 1940s, these historic dioramas were conceived as a means to inspire wonder and appreciation for the natural world, and to educate visitors about the fragile ecosystems threatened by unregulated hunting and development. Having been on permanent display for over 70 years, many of the zoological specimens were faded to such an extent that they no longer reflected the natural appearance of living animals, compromising the overall impact and effect of the dioramas. The renovation arose from a re-lamping project in which the original diorama lighting systems were to be replaced with modern fixtures. Previous testing in the Akeley Hall of African Mammals had demonstrated that it was possible to reduce heat and light levels inside the dioramas – while maintaining the desired visual appearance – through the use of energy-efficient lamps. As the re-lamping project would extend the exhibit life of the materials within the dioramas, the renovation team became motivated to explore complimentary methods of restoring naturalistic color to specimens that had become faded and desiccated in the original harsh lighting environment. Several important factors limited the materials that could be considered for recoloring. As the lighting design in each diorama reflects a specific location, season, and time of day, the light levels often greatly exceed that of a typical art exhibition space. Additionally, the larger taxidermy mounts are permanently embedded into the wire-and-plaster matrix of the diorama floors and cannot be removed for treatment. Finally, the dioramas themselves are not air-tight and accumulate dust over time. For the treatment to be successful, any materials used had to be lightfast, allow for application in situ with no rinsing of excess colorant, and had to impart minimal alteration to the physical characteristics of the hairs, helping to insure that specimens can be cleaned and groomed in the future. Preliminary investigation into contemporary taxidermy restoration practices revealed few references to materials used in recoloring faded mounts. Some institutions have reported success with commercial hair dyes, while acrylic paints are commonly used among taxidermists. The American Museum of Natural History conservation team ultimately chose to focus its investigation on Wildlife Colors acrylic paint (commercially available acrylic paints used by taxidermists), Orasol dyes (solvent-soluble metal-complex dyes with uses in conservation treatments), and XSL micronized pigments (water-dispersible pigments). Conservators worked closely with the project taxidermist and partnered with outside conservation scientists to assess these materials against the necessary criteria. Physical attributes of colored hair samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy, and the lightfastness of dyes and pigments was tested using microfadeometry and accelerated aging. The investigation has contributed to a better understanding of aging properties in these materials, and has led to innovative recoloring methods that prioritize long-term stability and retreatability.},

However, Bontecou’s method of directly applying the soot to the paper support with an acetylene torch was a new approach. The treatment of an early soot drawing, Untitled, from 1958, was the impetus for this research, and an understanding of the medium was necessary before treatment. Bontecou’s working method and manipulation of the medium were investigated with visual examination and mock-ups. Discussion with the artist provided further insight into her technique, materials, and use of fixative. While very similar in many respects to other friable media, soot has some distinctively different characteristics and properties. Although the main component of soot is carbon, organic species are present due to incomplete combustion and contaminants. Paper samples covered with acetylene torch soot were analyzed. This innovative use and application of a traditional medium by a contemporary artist has presented interesting questions for treatment, display, and storage.},

	volume = {11},
	abstract = {Information on the light-fastness of natural dyes is reviewed. New tests on the fastness of several dyes in fluorescent lamp light are reported. Nearly all natural dyes have a light-fastness below BS grade 5. Most have a fastness below 4. Nearly all natural dyes will fade badly during an exposure to 50 million lux hours of artificial light, or to a much smaller dose of daylight. In many museum displays serious fading of most dyes would occur in less than fifty years. There is no very effective way of reducing the rate of fading. Ultraviolet absorbers over light sources give a worthwhile increase in light-fastness to most, but not all, dyes. Low relative humidity reduces fading. Display in cases filled with an 'inert' gas benefits most dyes but accelerates the fading of some pigments used on fabrics. Valuable textiles whose dyes have a light-fastness below 6 should not be permanently displayed. Examen des reseignements sur la résistance à la lumière des teintures naturelles (voir tableau 1). Description de nouvelles épreuves sur la résistance de plusieurs pigments à la lumière des lampes fluorescentes (voir tableaux 3 et 4). Presque tous les colorants naturels ont une résistance à la lumière inférieure à la norme 'British Standard grade 5'. La plupart ont une résistance inférieure à 4. Presque tous les colorants naturels passent sérieusement lorsqu'ils sont exposés à 50 millions de lux-heures de lumière artificielle ou à une dose beaucoup plus faible de lumière naturelle. Dans bien des musées, une décoloration sérieuse de la plupart des colorants se produirait en moins de 50 ans. Il n'y a pas de méthode très efficace pour réduire le taux de décoloration. Des dispositifs qui absorbent les rayons ultra-violets, placés sur les sources de lumière, permettent d'augmenter de façon intéressante la résistance à la lumière et à la plupart des colorants, mais non pas de tous. Si l'humidité relative est basse, la décoloration est régulière. Si l'on place tous les articles exposés dans des boîtes contenant un gaz inerte, la plupart des colorants résistent mieux, mais la décoloration de certains pigments utilisée sur des textiles en est accélérée. Il ne faudrait pas exposer de façon permanente des textiles de valeur dont les colorants ont une résistance à la lumière inférieure à la norme British Standard 6.},

	title = {Microbial environmental monitoring in museums: preventive conservation of graphic collections},
	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Summary In museums, the biological component of indoor air, called bioaerosol or biological aerosol, is a potential biodeteriogen for graphic collections. The biological particles settling on the surface of artworks find favorable nutritional and environmental conditions for their growth, and promote biodeterioration. As is well known, biological attacks depend on microclimatic conditions; for this reason their control is essential to assess contamination and estimate biological risks. This article presents the partial application of a methodological model, in the National Institute of Graphic Arts (Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica-ING), a museum of international importance in Rome, on a collection of ancient drawings in the Fondo Corsini, preserved in repository no.1. This model is based on an integrated system of biological environmental monitoring (air and surfaces) in association with microclimatic monitoring (repository no.1, cabinet no.6, volumes, drawings and outdoor) carried out in an interdisciplinary research project. The values of thermohygrometric parameters were stable enough during the monitored month and had no daily fluctuations. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of air contamination and that on the surfaces of drawings did not show a critical situation. This article describes a pilot study which has focused attention on the biological contamination of the graphic collections and is a contribution to standardizing a system of diagnosis-intervention for preventive conservation of organic cultural heritage preserved in museums and in other indoor environments and the protection of the health of operators and visitors. Résumé Dans les musées, la composante biologique de l’air, appelée bioaerosol ou aérosol biologique, correspond à une menace potentielle de détérioration biologique pour les collections d’arts graphiques sur support papier. Lorsqu’elles se déposent sur la surface de l’objet, et lorsqu’elles y trouvent des conditions nutritionnelles et environnementales favorables à leur croissance, les particules biologiques en provoquent la biodétérioration. Il est bien connu que les attaques biologiques sont fortement influencées par les conditions microclimatiques. Dès lors, il devient primordial de les contrôler pour évaluer la contamination et pour estimer le risque biologique. Cet article traite de l’application partielle d’un modèle méthodologique chez l’Institut national des arts graphiques (Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica, ING), un organisme muséal d’importance internationale dont le siège est à Rome, notamment sur un recueil de dessins anciens du Fonds Corsini conservés dans le dépôt de conservation n. 1. Ce modèle est fondé sur un système intégré de surveillance microbiologique (air et surfaces) et surveillance microclimatique (environnement interne et externe, oeuvres et éléments de la décoration), qui a été mis en place dans le cadre d’un projet de recherche multidisciplinaire. Les résultats obtenus montrent que les paramètres thermiques et hydrométriques ne fluctuent pas au cours du mois étudié, leur évolution étant stable. L’analyse qualiquantitative de la contamination microbienne de l’air et des surfaces des dessins fait ressortir l’absence de criticités. Ce travail relate les résultats d’une étude pilote qui s’est concentrée tout particulièrement sur le risque biologique pour les collections d’arts graphiques, afin de contribuer à la standardisation d’un système de diagnostic et d’intervention pour la conservation préventive du patrimoine culturel de nature organique des musées et de tous les lieux de conservation et d’exposition confinés, en vue d’assurer aussi la protection de la santé des opérateurs et des visiteurs. Zusammenfassung In den Museen stellt die als Bio-Aerosol oder biologisches Aerosol bezeichnete Komponente der Luft einen potentiellen biologischen Schadfaktor für alle grafischen Sammlungen dar, deren Trägermaterial Papier ist. Wenn biologische Partikel sich auf der Oberfläche eines Manufakts ablagern und dort für ihr Wachstum günstige Ernährungs und Umgebungsbedingungen vorfinden, verursachen sie eine biologische Schädigung. Wie bekannt, sind biologische Angriffe stark von den mikroklimatischen Bedingungen abhängig. Deshalb ist deren Kontrolle eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für die Beurteilung der Kontamination und die Einschätzung des biologischen Risikos. In diesem Artikel präsentieren wir die partielle Anwendung einer Modellmethode beim Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica (ING), einer Museums-Organisation von internationaler Bedeutung mit Sitz in Rom. Diese Anwendung betrifft eine Sammlung antiker Zeichnungen aus dem Besitz des Fondo Corsini, die im Konservierungslager Nr. 1 verwahrt ist. Das genannte Modell basiert auf einem integrierten (Luft und Flächen) mikrobiologischen und mikroklimatischen Überwachungssystem (Umgebung innen und außen, Werke und Einrichtung) und wurde aufgrund eines interdisziplinären Forschungsprojekts realisiert. Aus den Ergebnissen zeigt sich, dass die Wärmeund Feuchtigkeitsparameter während des gesamten Überwachungsmonats keine Schwankungen aufweisen und der Verlauf der Werte gleichbleibend ist. Aus der Qualitäts- und Mengenanalyse der bakteriellen Kontamination der Luft und der Oberflächen der Zeichnungen ergibt sich eine nicht kritische Situation. Das vorliegende Schriftstück berichtet über eine Pilotstudie, deren Brennpunkt das biologische Risiko für graphische Sammlungen war. Sie soll zur Standardisierung eines Diagnose- und Maßnahmensystems zur vorbeugenden Konservierung des Kulturbestands aus organischem Material beitragen, der in den Museen bzw. in geschlossenen Aufbewahrungs- und Ausstellungsräumen verwahrt ist, sowie zum Schutz der Gesundheit von Beschäftigten und Besuchern.},

For unknown reasons, air pockets from the window regions in the mounts had ‘radiated’ similarly shaped discolorations several layers deep into stacks of museum boards and sometimes in the mounted prints and drawings. The resulting discoloration patterns consisting of combinations of partially overlapping rectangles in different shades of brown are reminiscent of Mondriaan paintings. The phenomenon was therefore coined the 'Mondriaan effect'. This study reports experimental evidence for the occurrence of thermal gradient induced moisture flow, affected by the presence of air pockets in stacks of museum board. It is concluded that these water flows can cause window-shaped distribution patterns of water soluble coloured components generally present in paper based materials. Recommendations for the storage of prints and drawings are given.},

	title = {Ultraviolet-{Induced} {Visible} {Fluorescence} and {Chemical} {Analysis} as {Tools} for {Examining} {Featherwork}},
	volume = {21},
	abstract = {Feathers are found in cultural heritage collections of tribal arts from the Americas, Africa, and the Pacific as well as in contemporary art, European and American fashion, and in taxidermy and ornithology specimens. Although museum conservators routinely evaluate feathers by looking at insect damage and mechanical wear, as well as fading as evidence of light exposure, examination of feathers for visible fluorescence under an ultraviolet (UV) source is atypical. Recent research by both the authors and bird biologists indicate that nondestructive UV fluorescence examination can provide valuable information about the identification and pigmentation of feathers found in museum collections, but must be used with caution as both light exposure and adventitious materials may compromise fluorescence. The authors also evaluate different methods of chemical analysis for detecting light-induced chemical changes in feathers. Recent research conducted jointly by UCLA and the Getty Conservation Institute illustrated the importance of identifying feather pigmentation systems in the design of a preventive conservation strategy. The difference in the quantity of light needed to fade undyed feathers can be 10-fold depending on the colorant systems present in the feather and the emission spectrum of the light. Feathers with color derived from the scattering of light through small scale feather structures are known to be more light-stable than feathers with coloration based on biological pigments. A number of feather pigments, including psittacofulvins found only in red and yellow pigments in birds in the Psittaciforme family, as well as porphyrins found in rusty brown owl plumage, may be identified by their specific ultraviolet-induced visible fluorescence (UVIVF). Feathers whose pigments are not directly fluorescent may still undergo appearance changes under an UV source as a consequence of light aging. Fluorescence is an early marker of chemical change, and can be used to detect such change before it can be measured colorimetrically. Beyond knowing that UV fluorescence is a stable attribute of some feather pigments, and a light-sensitive attribute in others, the current authors were motivated to determine whether color shifts visible in UV-induced fluorescence could provide a nondestructive marker of photochemical change to the keratin feather structure. This article describes a variety of analytical techniques applied to light-aged feather samples to present the most sensitive methods for detecting chemical changes that parallel fluorescence changes. Museum feather work, some with records of estimated display, were examined using UVIVF both to document psittacofulvin pigmented feathers expected to display fluorescence, and to compare non-psittacofulvin-pigmented feathers with accelerated-aged feather sample},

	abstract = {The occurrence of fluorescence in association to Grown stons ow paper, for instance, around iron-gall ink writings, at the tideline in water stains, and on foxing stains is a frequently observed phenomenon in paper conservation practice. In order to investigate the relationship between fluorescence and discolouration of paper, changes in the fluorescence of two additive-free papers submitted to artificial ageing have been monitored both visually and spectroscopically, and the results were compared with the information obtained from the UV-WS reflectance spectra of the same samples by using colour analysis. Both papers exhibited an increased overall fluorescence upon artificial ageing, which shows a single emission maximum at 445-450 nm (excitation wavelength = 365 nmj. The increase in fluorescence intensity and the discolouration of the test papers ocured simultaneuosly. Whereas for one of the papers (cotton cellulose) no change in the spectral distribution of fluorescence was observed, the formation of new fluorescent species was indicated in the fluorescence spectrum of the other sample (bleached chemical pulp) . which displayed a perceptible shift in chromaticity. The visually observed colour changes in the fluorescence of the investigated papers under ultraviolet illumination may therefore be attributed to a combined effect of discolouration and fluorescence. The changes in intensity and colour of fluorescence of paper observed in this study reproduce, to some extent, the changes in fluorescence associated to iron-gall inks, wet-dry interfaces, and foxing agents, which are reported in the literature. These results support the idea of a possible common underlying mechanism to explain the fluorescence of paper under the influence of different degrading factors.},

Photochromism can be utilised in a variety of textile products from everyday clothing to high-technology applications such as protective textiles, medical textiles, geo-textiles and sports textiles. Although photochromic materials have been used since 1960 to cut down the transmission of light through the lenses in sunglasses, there has been limited further development since that time due to technical difficulties not only in the application of photochromic colourants, but also with the measurement of kinetic colour changing properties. Renewed interest in photochromic textiles has arisen due to improved commercial potential in particular for applications as photochromic nanofibres, in ‘smart’ textiles and in ‘smart’ clothing.},

The method is based on the solvent extraction of flavonoids from raw plant materials (weld, dyer's broom and old fustic), aged and not aged alum-mordanted wool dyed specimens; subsequently, flavonoids are derivatised with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and analysed by GC-MS. The method easily allows the identification of a dyestuff by the detection of the molecular markers apigenin, luteolin, genistein, morin, maclurin, together with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,4,6- trihydroxybenzoic acid, which survive in aged textiles.

Recently developed tools in the conservation field and explorative approaches that can help in the design of an appropriate lighting policy for sensitive collection items are presented. Use of the microfade tester to assess the light sensitivity of collection items is described. The paper also describes how microfadotesting results can be used in combination with innovative visual tools based on model rendering of color in order to facilitate a decision on the establishment of the “Preservation Target” for a given collection item. Setting a Preservation Target is key to designing the appropriate lighting policy for sensitive collection items. In parallel, appropriate lighting policies strive to optimize the collection items perceived value by allowing viewers to experience it in the museum context, while minimizing risk of light induced degradation.},

Available scientific evidence for air pollution induced damage of paper material is reviewed and weighed against financial and environmental costs of air pollution control. Exposure of paper to both indoor and outdoor generated air pollutants at typical concentration levels observed within storage areas is expected to cause minimal to no additional yellowing and embrittlement, while the costs of chemical air filtration are significant.

Dans chaque ville en France et en Europe on ferait un constat analogue. Cependant l'histoire ne s'est intéressée que fort peu à une pratique réputée futile. On la réhabilite ici en montrant la portée et les effets. Le présent livre entend jeter les bases d'une étude systématique de l'étrange activité qui consiste à rassembler des objets pour constituer une collection. Il propose une anthropologie de la collection : phénomène universel, apparemment coextensif à la culture même et véhicule privilégié de ses transformations. Il donne une étude historique des principaux genres de collection dans l'Europe moderne, des antiquités à l'histoire naturelle, de la numismatique à la peinture. C'est un nouvel éclairage sur la genèse du musée qui est suggéré, la collection particulière révélant son rôle crucial d'institution novatrice.},

	abstract = {Le statut si particulier de la collection a fait l'objet de théories diverses et contradictoires, ici répertoriées. Pour certains il ne peut y avoir d'histoire des collections, car l'intérêt collectionneur, universel et éternel, relève de la seule psychologie. Chez d'autres l'histoire des collections n'est que le reflet d'une histoire des idées et des goûts esthétiques de la société des amateurs. Dans ces deux hypothèses, les plus courantes, la transformation de collections privées en musée public n'est qu'une vicissitude sans grandes conséquences. On tient généralement la collection pour figure déterminante de l'histoire des rapports aux objets, le musée n'étant que construction idéologique particulière. L'analyse sociologique, comme l'histoire du goût, travaillent sur les collectionneurs et les mécènes; l'épistémologue ou l'historien d'art sur les ruptures dans l'ordre des systèmes de pensée ou des modes. Le clivage privé/public ne retrouve toute sa pertinence qu'à l'intérieur du champ (v. au verso) institutionnel. Si l'on tient que le musée a une histoire qui n'est pas celle de la collection, il faut partir de cette évidence qu'il est d'abord institution, et ne pas considérer exclusivement son fonds. On devra dès lors explorer les rapports qu'il entretient avec l'académie et l'école de dessin, les liens tissés avec les techniques d'inventaire et les mutations architecturales (l'éclairage et la disposition), la dépendance politique à l'égard des visées d'utilité (économique et nationale), comme du souci d'instruction et de progrès des arts. Une typologie « archéologique » reste à fonder ; s'opposent ainsi l'exposition de la qualité des œuvres et l'exposition du devenir des maîtres, le musée encyclopédique à fins pédagogiques et le musée-mémorial du grand homme, le musée traditionnel et le musée déterritorialisé, ou musée jacobin.},

The textbook examines the basic technologies needed to support image processing applications, including the characterization of continuous images, image sampling and quantization techniques, and two-dimensional signal processing techniques. It then covers the two principle areas of image processing: image enhancement and restoration techniques and extraction of information from an image. It concludes with discussions of image and video compression. Covers the mathematical representation of continuous images and discrete images Discusses the psychophysical properties of human vision Analyzes and compares linear processing techniques implemented by direct convolution and Fourier domain filtering Details restoration models, point and spatial restoration and geometrical image modification Includes morphological image processing, edge detection, image feature extraction, image segmentation, object shape analysis, and object detection Describes coding technique applicable to still image and video coding based upon point and spatial processing Outlines the widely adopted JPEG and MPEG still image and video coding standards The author’s accessible style provides historical background on the development of image processing techniques as well as a theoretical exposition.

With the microfading technique, developed to test the light fastness of a tiny test area on objects of cultural value, this comparison is made by absolute colour change after exposure. This article presents a new approach to enhance data interpretation of light-fastness tests by the use of the rate of colour change. The procedure is combined with the conventional classification process using absolute colour change. The new classification system with the rate of colour change was applied to 44 samples, 13 of them were classified in more sensitive Blue Wool categories when analysing the rate of colour change. The perspective of rate of colour change helps to enhance data interpretation especially of samples showing fading characteristics different from the light-fastness standards.},

To assure the carpet’s longevity and to be able to make valid decisions about the benefits ensuing from different lighting proposals, changes in the carpet on exposure must be determined and expressed in terms of visibility. The article describes the experiments on the carpet to determine, with a high degree of confidence, the response of different colours to illumination, together with the research resulting in a model of the likelihood of detecting a given colour change. Combining these two pieces of research, the solution of illuminating the carpet for 10 minutes in every half-hour whilst the gallery is open ensures an appropriate balance between the immediate visual impact and the long term preservation of the appearance of this uniquely beautiful carpet.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.saa.2018.04.008},
	abstract = {The characterization of ancient and modern alizarin-based lakes is a largely studied topic in the literature. Analytical data on contemporary alizarin-based lakes, however, are still poor, though of primary importance, since these lakes might be indeed present in contemporary and fake paintings as well as in retouchings. In this work we systematically investigate the chemical composition and the optical features of fifteen alizarin-based lakes, by a multi-analytical technique approach combining spectroscopic methods (i.e. Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy, EDXRF; Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, ATR-FTIR; X-ray Powder Diffraction, XRD; UV induced fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopies) and chromatography (i.e. High-performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with a Photodiode Array Detector, HPLC-PDA). Most of the samples contain typical compounds from the natural roots of madder, as occurring in ancient and modern lakes, but in two samples (23600-Kremer-Pigmente and alizarin crimson-Zecchi) any anthraquinonic structures were identified, thus leading to hypothesize the presence of synthetic dyes. The detection of lucidin primeveroside and ruberythrique acid in some lakes suggest the use of Rubia tinctorum. One sample (23610-Kremer-Pigmente) presents alizarin as the sole compound, thereby revealing to be a synthetic dye. Moreover, gibbsite, alunite and kaolinite were found to be used as substrates and/or mordants. Visible absorption spectra of the anthraquinonic lakes show two main absorption bands at about 494–511 nm and 537–564 nm, along with a shoulder at about 473–479 nm in presence of high amounts of purpurin. Finally, from the results obtained by UV induced fluorescence spectroscopy it is possible to figure out that, although it is commonly assumed that the madder lake presents an orange-pink fluorescence, the inorganic compounds, added to the recipe, could induce a quenching phenomenon or an inhibition of the fluorescence, as occurring in some commercial alizarin-based lakes.},

Given the enormity of the subject, we will only give a very limited account of this huge area of intellectual activity. We will first discuss the structure of the visual system that is necessary to understand the functional processing of visual information and its limitations. Next, we will elaborate on some classic visual psychophysical results that delineate the limits of detection and discrimination. With these basics, we will introduce the reader to three important streams of information processing pertinent to lighting and display technologies, namely, spatial vision, flicker fusion, and color vision. We do not discuss many aspects of visual perception such as binocular visual perception, shape and form recognition, face recognition, etc. due to space constraints. Good overviews and detailed discussions of various aspects of visual perception can be found in a number of books, e.g., Cornsweet (1970), Schwartz (2010), Palmer (1999), Norton et al.

In the first part of the study, the observers were asked if a colour difference could be observed, to assess the scale of a Just noticeable difference' (JND) in these complex scenes. In the second part, observers assessed the acceptability of a change over a period of 10, 50 or 100 years. The results demonstrated that the JND is sometimes larger in complex scenes than in simple colour pairs and that changes in smaller areas, more peripheral areas, or areas in abstract images are less noticeable. In the second phase of the study, changes to the figurative oil painting were generally deemed less acceptable than changes of equivalent magnitude in the abstract or watercolour images.

It often deteriorates, losing its colour and causing dramatic changes in the appearance of paintings. The changes in structure and elemental composition accompanying the loss of colour in the glass were examined in samples from paintings in the National Gallery, London and the Louvre using synchrotron micro X-ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron reflectance FTIR microspectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy and SEM-EDX. The leaching of potassium was found to be responsible for concurrent structural modifications in the glass: increase in polymerisation of the silicate network and change in cobalt coordination from tetrahedral towards octahedral, leading to colour change in the pigment. These results also form valuable reference data for examinations with lab-based techniques to distinguish between smalt that is degraded or a pale grey variety deliberately chosen by the artist.},

They refer to figurative arts, including paintings, tapestries and parchments. Among the large number of their components, attention is focused on polychromatic materials. Two main aspects are concerned: (1) the recognition of artwork components from their photophysical properties and (2) the study of the photochemical impact of light on artworks. For each of these lines, results from laboratory studies and in-situ investigations on real artworks are reported. Particular emphasis is given to the use of portable instrumentation which allows a non-invasive in-situ approach to works of art.},

Conventional chemical and mechanical cleaning methods suffer from the common phenomenon that the foreign matter is diluted into the substrate rather than removed. The application of a laser beam allows highly localized and optically specific interaction. However, the occurrence of extreme temperatures and light intensities may cause irreversible alteration of the paper matrix. Further, incomplete removal and/or chemical conversion of contaminations may result in insufficient cleaning or affect the ageing behaviour. Laser treatments were performed by Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers at three wavelengths (355 nm, 532 nm, and 1064 nm). Papers contaminated with inks and adhesive-tape remnants served as model samples. Multispectral imaging and colorimetric results served to quantify and systematize the results.},

	abstract = {Prussian blue pigments, highly insoluble mixed-valence iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II) complexes of typical stoichiometry Fe4III[FeII(CN)6]3·xH2O or KFeIII[FeII(CN)6]·xH2O, have been used as pigments in oil paintings and watercolors for 300 years. For poorly understood reasons, these pigments often fade with time. Although the preparation methods have been recognized since the mid-eighteenth century as a contributory factor in the fading of the pigment, the spectral and physical properties of Prussian blue that vary with the type of synthesis were not precisely identified. Several Prussian blue pigments have been prepared by different methods and characterized by thermogravimetric analyses, high-energy powder X-ray diffraction, atomic absorption and flame emission, UV–visible, iron-57 Mössbauer, iron K-edge X-ray absorption, and Raman spectroscopy. The type of synthesis influences the hue, tinting strength, and hiding power properties of the Prussian blue pigments. Two major features appear to be strongly dependent on the preparative methods, the particle size and the local disorder. Both a nitrogen atmosphere and an intermediate aging step of the Berlin white, Fe2II[FeII(CN)6], during the synthesis are required to obtain a highly colored pigment through the optimization of particle size, minimization in the perturbations to the FeII–CN–FeIII intervalence electron transfer pathway, and the minimization of disordered vacancies. The potassium containing Prussian blue structure has been revisited. It can be described with the Pm3m space group, where approximately one-quarter of the [FeII(CN)6]4– sites are vacant and where the potassium cation is located at a zeolitic-like position inside the lattice cavities. The degree of ordering of the [FeII(CN)6]4– vacancies in all Prussian blues was quantified using atomic pair distribution analysis, an ordering that is consistent with the iron K-edge X-ray absorption spectra. The presence of strain in the crystals is observed by both powder X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The structural similarity between the alkali-free, improperly referred to as “insoluble”, and the alkali containing, “soluble”, Prussian blues may explain why the two varieties are almost undistinguishable by spectroscopic techniques.},

	abstract = {Prussian blue, a hydrated iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II) complex, is a synthetic pigment discovered in Berlin in 1704. Because of both its highly intense color and its low cost, Prussian blue was widely used as a pigment in paintings until the 1970s. The early preparative methods were rapidly recognized as a contributory factor in the fading of the pigment, a fading already known by the mid-eighteenth century. Herein two typical eighteenth-century empirical recipes have been reproduced and the resulting pigment analyzed to better understand the reasons for this fading. X-ray absorption and Mössbauer spectroscopy indicated that the early syntheses lead to Prussian blue together with variable amounts of an undesirable iron(III) product. Pair distribution functional analysis confirmed the presence of nanocrystalline ferrihydrite, Fe10O14(OH)2, and also identified the presence of alumina hydrate, Al10O14(OH)2, with a particle size of 15 Å. Paint layers prepared from these pigments subjected to accelerated light exposure showed a tendency to turn green, a tendency that was often reported in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century books. The presence of particles of hydrous iron(III) oxides was also observed in a genuine eighteenth-century Prussian blue sample obtained from a polychrome sculpture.},

Recent results obtained from a long-term study of colour changes caused by display in the museum and short-term changes caused by transportation to loan exhibitions are presented. Improvements made to the procedure for acquiring, processing and presenting infrared reflectogram mosaics are also detailed.

It also provides advice for the reporting of the data. The availability of reliable and accurate photometric data for LED devices is a basic requirement for designing good lighting systems and evaluating performance of products. By obtaining these data through measurements in specific normalized measuring conditions, the consistency of the data should be ensured between different laboratories (within the limits of the declared measurement uncertainty) and comparison of different products on the same basis is possible. The standard specifies the requirements for measurement of electrical, photometric, and colorimetric quantities of LED lamps, LED modules and LED luminaires, for operation with AC or DC supply voltages, possibly with associated LED control gear. LED light engines are assimilated to LED modules and handled accordingly. Photometric and colorimetric quantities covered in this standard include total luminous flux, luminous efficacy, partial luminous flux, luminous intensity distribution, centre-beam intensity, luminance and luminance distribution, chromaticity coordinates, correlated colour temperature (CCT), colour rendering index (CRI), and angular colour uniformity. This standard does not cover LED packages and products based on OLEDs (organic LEDs). The standard aims in particular to cover measurement methods for testing the compliance of LED devices with the photometric and colorimetric requirements of LED performance standards issued by IEC/TC 34 “Lamps and related equipment”.},

These enclosures should mechanically protect the objects during transportation, prevent the deposition of dust and dirt and should provide basic protection against floods and fire at least to some extent. Currently, the importance of high quality corrugated cardboards as materials for protective enclosures is increasing rapidly. These cardboards must meet the standards ISO 16245-2009 respectively DIN/ISO 9706-2009, depending on their composition. This study documents the extent to which protective enclosures are able to compensate environmental fluctuations. Zusammenfassung Es ist heutzutage allgemeiner Standard, dass Sammlungsgegenstände in graphischen Sammlungen, Archiven und Bibliotheken in Schutzbehältnissen gelagert werden. Die Schutzbehältnisse haben die Aufgabe, die Objekte mechanisch beim Transport zu schützen, die Ablagerung von Staub und Schmutz zu verhindern, sie bieten darüber hinaus auch einen begrenzten Schutz bei Überflutungen oder gegenüber Feuer. Heutzutage werden vermehrt Wellpappen für die Herstellung von Schutzbehältnissen eingesetzt. Diese Wellpappen müssen bezüglich der Stoffzusammensetzung internationalen Standards, wie ISO 16245-2009 und DIN/ISO 9706-2009, genügen. In diesem Beitrag werden erste Untersuchungen zum Mikroklima in gefüllten bzw. ungefüllten Schutzbehältnissen vorgestellt und diskutiert, inwieweit Schutzbehältnisse externe Klimaschwankungen in Bezug auf das gelagerte Sammlungsgut dämpfen können. Résumé Aujourd'hui il est généralement reconnu que les oeuvres graphiques et objets de collections des archives et des bibliothèques doivent être conservés dans des conteneurs qui assurent leur protection. Ces conteneurs ou ces boîtes ont pour mission de protéger mécaniquement les objets lors du transport, d'éviter le dépôt de poussière ou de saleté et servent par ailleurs partiellement de rempart contre les inondations ou contre l'incendie. Actuellement le carton ondulé de qualité supérieure acquiert de plus en plus d'importance dans la fabrication de ces conteneurs de protection. La qualité de ces cartons ondulés doit être conforme aux standards internationaux, tels que ISO 16245-2009 et DIN/ISO 9706-2009. Dans cet article on présentera les premières expériences relatives au microclimat à l'intérieur de ces conteneurs vides ou remplis et on discutera de savoir dans quelle mesure ces conteneurs de protection peuvent atténuer l'influence des fluctuations climatiques externes sur les objets de collections qui y sont stockés.},

	abstract = {Conservation of artworks is primarily an ethical duty of our civilisation with respect of future generations but also a challenge for science and technology. In fact, many conservation problems of monuments, historical sites and museum collections require more and more sophisticated instrumentation to be understood and finally resolved. Laser techniques have been for a long time an attractive field of research coming from physics, but with limited attention by the conservation community. In the year 2000 an initiative of scientific cooperation started at European level, the COST Action G7, with the aim to promote “Artworks Conservation by Lasers” and possibly assess this innovation potential with well-established conclusions. A network of 36 organisations coming from 20 countries was soon realised, with the participation of physicists, chemists, biologists, architects, conservators and restorers. This interdisciplinary background was the correct basis to approach from different aspects the multifaceted problems encountered in the experimentation of laser techniques on a variety of materials and of deterioration causes. The peculiar properties of laser radiation such as monochromatic emission, coherence, collimation of the beam were aimed toward diagnostic applications to investigate the materials with non-invasive low power beams and provide immediate response. On the other hand the possibility to raise the laser power and determine selective and controlled ablative effects was the subject of the most debated application in the delicate phase of cleaning. During the COST G7 lifetime the exchange of experience and the comparison of the results could add significant advancements in the comprehension and control of the effects induced by cleaning. The selection of suitable setting of the laser parameters could avoid the side effects that were hindering the use of lasers in practice. Inter-change of young scientists by means of short-term scientific missions has spread best practices between us. An intensive series of 12 workshops dedicated to meet with conservators and restorers has transferred to a relevant number of stakeholders in the field of conservation a correct knowledge about the validation of laser techniques and main case studies. In conclusion COST G7 has completed in the 2006 its own mission, disseminating a proper information through the conservation community in Europe and worldwide, about how to use lasers in conservation with best possible exploitation of their technical benefits. Today these innovative instruments are considered as well-recognised tools for solving a variety of problems in conservation, such as cleaning of artworks, statues, monuments and historical buildings, detection of defects, on-site analysis of composition and 3D documentation. We are certain that laser technologies will be integrated with the traditional techniques in the immediate future. In this respect the COST G7 group gave a high priority for training of end-users with the aim to establish a proper knowledge and use of laser instruments and innovative methods for diagnostics, restoration interventions and monitoring of the deterioration. Consequently, we decided to contribute to training courses with our experience. This CD includes selected topics about laser techniques in conservation and is offered by COST G7 to the vast community of institutions devoted to education of experts in conservation and restoration.},

	abstract = {The second decade of the twenty-first century has become the period when light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are beginning to reach their promise of being the dominant technology for generating light. For those who have worked in this field, it is gratifying to see the enthusiasm of consumers for the technology and how the rate of adoption often outpaces expert projections. At the time of writing, leading manufacturers of lighting products achieve more than 40 \% of their revenue by sales of products that use LEDs as the light source (Philips Results Q3 2014), and this portion is projected to be over 80 \% by 2020. The rapid adoption of LEDs is largely due to the tremendous improvement in underlining technology which enabled cost reductions and an increase in functionality of lighting systems. The technological advances have produced commercial components with luminous efficacy over 200 lm/W. Such high efficiency allows not only for energy savings but also for the reduction in system cost as fewer LEDs and less heat sinking are needed to produce a desired amount of light. The growing production volumes and the beginning of standardization of technology and manufacturing methods are reducing the cost of LED components, further lowering barriers for adoption of solid-state lighting. Besides the energy savings, the basic flexibility of LED technology invites new possibilities such as choice in light color and the natural integration with electronic components enabling control systems such as occupancy detection and communication via modulated light. The long life and high brightness offer design flexibility as well as added safety for automotive applications, while the microelectronic nature of LEDs is even utilized for data transfer and communication (Philips creates shopping assistant with LEDs and smart phone; Elgala et al. 2011).},

Formic acid and acetic acid were quantified in three areas of the paper defined by the wet-dry boundary (above, below, and at the tideline) using capillary zone electrophoresis with indirect UV detection. Their concentration increased upon accelerated aging of the paper and was highest in the tideline. The hydroperoxides have been quantified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection based on the determination of triphenylphosphine oxide produced from the reaction with triphenylphosphine, and their highest concentration was found in the tideline as well. For the first time, it was shown that various types of hydroperoxides were present, water-soluble and non-water-soluble, most probably in part hydroperoxide functionalized cellulose. After accelerated aging, a significant increase in hydroperoxide concentration was found in all the paper areas. The molar masses of cellulose determined using size-exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering detection showed that, upon aging, cellulose degraded significantly more in the tideline area than in the other areas of the paper. The area below the tideline was more degraded than the area above. A kinetic study of the degradation of cellulose allowed determining the constants for glycosidic bond breaking in each of the areas of the paper.},

	abstract = {Depuis des siècles, les vernis apposés sur des œuvres anciennes sont constitués de résines naturelles. Ceux-ci se dégradent au cours du temps et modifient l’aspect visuel de l’œuvre. Les restaurateurs doivent donc alléger la couche de vernis à l’aide de solvants choisis selon la nature du vernis et n’altérant pas la couche picturale. L’identification des vernis est donc essentielle pour le choix solvant. Elle était, jusqu’ici obtenue par des analyses chimiques faites à partir de prélèvements. A l’aide de la fluorescence UV, nous avons développé une technique d’identification non-destructive des vernis, réalisable in-situ et donnant des résultats en temps réel. Cette méthode s’appuie sur la comparaison du spectre de fluorescence d’un vernis inconnu avec ceux d’une base de données de vernis de référence récents, vieillis artificiellement ou naturellement. Des exemples de reconnaissance des vernis sur plusieurs œuvres d’art du patrimoine sont présentés. Parallèlement, la séparation et l’identification des principaux fluorophores contenus au sein des résines ont été réalisées par chromatographie liquide couplée à la spectrométrie de masse utilisant l'ionisation par électrospray.},

	abstract = {Modern water-borne paints are widely used in different areas of applications ranging from high-gloss lacquers to flat, scrub-resistant interior paints. From this point of view, the pigment volume concentration (PVC) is one key-parameter adjusting the desired application properties. In high-gloss paints, for example, a low PVC is required to accommodate the proper surface roughness to achieve a high gloss. Consequently, a high concentration of TiO2 is needed to obtain a good hiding power at the same time. Flat paints nonetheless are highly filled due to cost reasons preferentially by CaCO3 and the pigment binding capacity of the binder is crucial. In this work, paint formulations differing in PVC, and the type of binder or dispersing agent were investigated by various techniques concerning the distribution and aggregation of pigment particles, e.g. TiO2. To get a detailed insight into the structure of the liquid paints and the corresponding dried paint films, suitable analytical tools were applied for characterization. The structure of the liquid paints was analyzed by remission light spectroscopy (RLS), disc centrifugation, cryogenic-replication transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-replica TEM) and cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM). The pigment distribution in the corresponding dried paint films was examined by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), TEM and RLS. The tendency of the TiO2-pigments to form aggregates was found to depend on both: first on the type of binder used in the formulation and second on the employed dispersing agent. It is shown that only by adjusting the properties of the binder in combination with common dispersants, it is possible to get well-distributed TiO2 particles within the paint. Correlation of application properties, e.g. gloss and blocking to the microscopic structure is presented.},

For science students, it provides a broad introduction to the subject and the many applications of colour. To more applied students, such as engineering and arts students, it provides the essential scientific background to colour and the many applications. New to this Edition: The chapter framework of the first edition will be retained, with each chapter being substantially rewritten and some material would be relocated. Some chapters will be rewritten in a clearer fashion, e.g. There have been no significant advances in the understanding of rainbows recently, but the text could be clarified and improved. Colour has been an important attribute of many nano-particle containing systems, such as quantum dots. This aspect will be included, e.g. the colour of gold ruby glass, described in Chapter 5 as part of scattering phenomena now is better treated in terms of gold nanoparticles and surface plasmons. This would probably be transferred to Chapter 10 and considered in tandem with the colour of metals such as copper, silver and gold. A similar state of affairs applies to silver nanoparticles and polychromic glass. Some chapters will include extensive new material, e.g. Chapter 8, colours due to molecular processes [organic LEDs etc], and Chapter 12, Displays, [touch screen technologies]. For all chapters it would be intended to take into account the current scientific literature up to the time of submission – say up to the end of 2009. The end of chapter Further Reading sections would reflect this up-to-date overview. The end of chapter problems will be strengthened and expanded.},

	volume = {9016},
	abstract = {This study describes a non-invasive analytical imaging scanning technique utilizing multispectral images to study discoloration and degradation of pigments used in traditional Japanese artworks. The images have high spatial resolution which can achieve mesoscopic resolution (typically 0.1mm-10mm). Since the images are being scanned line by line instead of being recorded frame by frame, this enables accurate color and spectral recording of the material response from visible and near infrared irradiation. The multispectral images were used to reconstruct color information and spectral reflectance. The mathematical model is based on the Moore-Penrose pseuodoinverse. Using mesoscopically resolvable images, it is possible to measure the spectral reflectance of pigments ranging from μm-mm ROI unlike conventional spectrometers that requires big sampling area. The significance of mesoscopically-resolved analysis is demonstrated by investigating the discoloration and degradation of natural and artificial Japanese pigments. The pigments were heated in air at 300°C and sampled every 10 minutes. It was observed that the pigments discolored at seemingly random clusters. The reconstruction of the spectral reflectance at different sizes of ROI reveals strong correlation with background reflection. The size of the initial discoloration sites makes it impossible to measure using conventional spectrometers. It was observed that by using sub-mm ROI, it is possible to observe reflection and absorption patterns in the pigments which does not register with mm-scale ROI. The results have shown that mesoscopically resolvable multispectral images can be used effectively to study degradation and discoloration in pigments.},

	title = {The use of ultraviolet-induced visible fluorescence for examination of photographs},
	abstract = {Ultraviolet radiation has been widely used in art conservation as a non-destructive examination and photographic technique, providing useful information about museum objects. A number of separate studies have shown promising applications of ultraviolet-induced visible fluorescence to examine photographs. However, no comprehensive study specific to photographic materials currently exists. The project evaluates the application and limitations of ultraviolet-induced visible fluorescence examination for the identification, characterization, condition assessment, and treatment of photographs. A comprehensive examination of photographic materials, from daguerreotypes to color prints, was carried out using shortwave and longwave ultraviolet radiation. The study explores how photographic materials or a composite of different photographic materials interact with ultraviolet radiation, attempts to provide explanations of the observed phenomena, and discusses the use of such observations for photograph conservation. The report provides guidelines for using ultraviolet radiation to examine and record fluorescence, by providing information about the theory of ultraviolet-induced visible fluorescence, the ultraviolet radiation sources, the literature references, and the working procedure, including safety, examination, documentation, and standardization issues. For instance, digital cameras proved to be efficient for documenting fluorescence, showing clear advantages over photographic films. A fluorescent target suitable for fluorescence photography of museum objects is also proposed. The research shows the wide range of fluorescence that occurs in photographic materials, and that it can produce relevant information, such as the detection of ultraviolet absorbing layer in color prints, some tarnish on daguerreotypes, or some coatings applied on various types of photographs. The research also shows that the technique can have relevant application to treatment. For example, prior examination under ultraviolet radiation can reveal the presence of unexpected materials or areas of differential aging. The report is supplemented by a library of images that provides clear visual references. This library can serve as the foundation for further studies on the fluorescence occurring in photographs, for more in-depth examinations of certain fluorescence phenomena, and for further study of other examination techniques, such as infrared photography.},

Light ageing of the paints indicated that the synthetic pigment eosin, very popular in Vincent’s time, fades much faster than other lakes used by Vincent van Gogh. Lakes made from madder, Kopp’s purpurin and cochineal on alumina faded more slowly than those made from brasilwood, eosin, and cochineal on tin. Total fading of the latter pigments occurred within the equivalent of 10 years of light exposure under museum conditions (by reciprocity).

	volume = {84},
	doi = {10.1021/ac3015627},
	abstract = {Over the past years a number of studies have described the instability of the pigment cadmium yellow (CdS). In a previous paper we have shown how cadmium sulfide on paintings by James Ensor oxidizes to CdSO4·H2O. The degradation process gives rise to the fading of the bright yellow color and the formation of disfiguring white crystals that are present on the paint surface in approximately 50 μm sized globular agglomerations. Here, we study cadmium yellow in the painting “Flowers in a blue vase” by Vincent van Gogh. This painting differs from the Ensor case in the fact that (a) a varnish was superimposed onto the degraded paint surface and (b) the CdS paint area is entirely covered with an opaque crust. The latter obscures the yellow color completely and thus presents a seemingly more advanced state of degradation. Analysis of a cross-sectioned and a crushed sample by combining scanning microscopic X-ray diffraction (μ-XRD), microscopic X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (μ-XANES), microscopic X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) based chemical state mapping and scanning microscopic Fourier transform infrared (μ-FT-IR) spectrometry allowed unravelling the complex alteration pathway. Although no crystalline CdSO4 compounds were identified on the Van Gogh paint samples, we conclude that the observed degradation was initially caused by oxidation of the original CdS pigment, similar as for the previous Ensor case. However, due to the presence of an overlying varnish containing lead-based driers and oxalate ions, secondary reactions took place. In particular, it appears that upon the photoinduced oxidation of its sulfidic counterion, the Cd2+ ions reprecipitated at the paint/varnish interface after having formed a complex with oxalate ions that themselves are considered to be degradation products of the resin and/or oil in the varnish. The SO42– anions, for their part, found a suitable reaction partner in Pb2+ ions stemming from a dissolved lead-based siccative that was added to the varnish to promote its drying. The resulting opaque anglesite compound in the varnish, in combination with the underlying CdC2O4 layer at the paint/varnish interface, account for the orange-gray crust that is disfiguring the painting on a macroscopic level. In this way, the results presented in this paper demonstrate how, through a judicious combined use of several microanalytical methods with speciation capabilities, many new insights can be obtained from two minute, but highly complex and heterogeneous paint samples.},

A very rare lead mineral, plumbonacrite (3 PbCO 3Pb(OH) 2 ·PbO), was revealed to be present. This is the first reported occurrence of this compound in a painting dating from before the mid 20th century. It constitutes the missing link between on the one hand the photoinduced reduction of red lead and on the other hand (hydro)cerussite, and thus sheds new light on the whitening of red lead.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of species age, which allows one to separate transport and chemistry in a photochemical model. This separation is an approximation that can lead to substantial decreases in the computational burden of photochemical modeling. Thus, the method can be used to simulate a large number of cases to select a few for more detailed study with a comprehensive photochemical model. The concept of species age can also be used to probe observations directly to draw inferences on the impact of precursor emission changes at specific sources on observed ozone levels. Species age is computed using a conservation equation derived in this paper. The pollutants are initially transported within the airshed as inert species for the required simulation time. These inert concentrations are then allowed to react over the appropriate species ages to yield ozone concentrations. Computational efficiency is obtained by performing chemistry as a post-processing step only at the receptors of interest. The usefulness of the species age concept has been evaluated by comparing results from a model that uncouples transport and chemistry to those from a comprehensive photochemical model applied to an ozone episode observed during the Lake Michigan Oxidant study in 1991. The initial results are very encouraging.},

	abstract = {This study is part of a larger research project dedicated to digital print preservation issues – the Digital Print Preservation Portal (DP3). This work quantifies the potential of glazing materials to mitigate different types of light-induced damage – colorant fade, paper yellowing, changes in paper gloss, and loss of optical brightening agent (OBA) function – that occur to digitally printed photographs and documents when on display. Prints were subjected to xenon lighting to simulate daylight through window glass in a series of arrangements: without glazing, with plain framing glass (soda-lime) in a sealed or unsealed package, and with UV blocking glass in a sealed or unsealed package. Sealed packages served the purpose of isolating the samples from atmospheric pollutants, known to contribute to the deterioration of certain print types. In this study, the use of UV-filtering glass protected prints from colorant fade, paper yellowing, and paper gloss change to an extent. Protection conveyed by plain glass was less comprehensive and less effective than UV glass. Neither type of glazing was able to keep the OBAs functional by the end of the light exposure. It was also seen that light-induced damage to digital prints is due not only to UV radiation, but also to visible light, and that different digital prints may be more vulnerable to one or the other. Protecting sensitive prints from UV radiation and budgeting the amount of light they may be exposed to should be essential to any print display policy in order to ensure longevity.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet-induced fluorescence spectroscopy is a commonly used technique for the characterization and identification of painting materials, such as organic binders and colorants. Its interpretation is strictly connected to both the experimental setup and an understanding of the physical and chemical interactions among materials in paint layers, which are commonly composed of a fluorescent organic binder and a pigment. When irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, the light emitted by fluorophores present in the organic binder undergoes several types of interactions, in particular scattering and absorption by neighboring pigmented particles and auto-absorption. As a result of scattering and absorption phenomena, the emission spectrum is deformed according to the physical properties of the surrounding pigmented particles. This can lead to shifts of the emission maxima and/or to the formation of apparent new emission bands. The extent of the modifications to the emission spectra, caused by auto-absorption and selective absorption phenomena, may lead to the erroneous characterization or identification of the fluorescent materials. As a consequence, the interpretation of the emission signal can be greatly compromised. A correction based on the Kubelka-Munk theory is proposed to evaluate the extent of the spectral distortion and is assessed on modern replicas of wall paintings of known composition. Although the model cannot be applied to all cases, qualitative distinctions between real and apparent emissions are achieved.},

So far, these activities have been set in designated exhibition areas and at a changing rate, which the conservators could keep up with. Nowadays, other areas of the library have been designated as areas where ad-hoc exhibitions take place. The exhibition areas have a huge range of values of visible light and UV radiation, while the library exhibits a variety of objects having a wide range of light sensitivities. In order to deal with the risk for fading associated with the new exhibition approach, a tool for curators and exhibition editors has been developed to ease and enhance the decision making process. The emphasis is placed on identifying the objects that can be exhibited and the maximum allowed exhibition time in different building locations with the goal of reducing the risk of experiencing a just noticeable fade. This light risk map has been developed using meteorological information about hours of daylight during the seasons, measured maximum light levels in different locations and taking into account the light sensitivity of different materials compared to the ISO Blue Wool Fading Standard scale. The map gives an easy understandable overview of the time each type of material can withstand perceivable colour change in different locations. The calculations and the resulting light map have been received with interest and good-will since they provide a useful tool for curators allowing them to better understand the possible impact of exhibition lighting. This means that instead of just being restrictive, conservators and curators can work together on identifying risk for light sensitive materials, which are planned to be exhibited, in order to take preventive measures.},

The multispectral Portable Light Dome (MS PLD) consists of a hemispherical structure, an overhead camera and LEDs emitting in five parts of the electromagnetic spectrum regularly covering the dome’s inside surface. With the associated software solution, virtual relighting and enhancements can be applied in a real-time, interactive manner. The system extracts genuine 3D and shading information based on a photometric stereo algorithm. This innovative approach allows for instantaneous alternations between the computations in the infrared, red, green, blue and ultraviolet spectra. The MS PLD system has been tested for research ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to ancient Egyptian artefacts. Preliminary results have shown that it documents and measures the 3D surface structure of objects, re-visualises underdrawings, faded pigments and inscriptions, and examines the MS results in combination with the actual relief characteristics of the physical object. Newly developed features are reflection maps and histograms, analytic visualisations of the reflection properties of all separate LEDs or selected areas. In its capacity as imaging technology, the system acts as a tool for the analysis of surface materials (e.g. identification of blue pigments, gold and metallic surfaces). Besides offering support in answering questions of attribution and monitoring changes and decay of materials, the PLD also contributes to the identification of materials, all essential factors when making decisions in the conservation protocol.},

	title = {Operating in the dark, an exploration of an atlas for ultraviolet induced visible fluorescence examination of paper artefacts},
	abstract = {In the field of conservation there is a constant demand for the systematization of processes and structuration of knowledge in models and checklists designed to help the conservator-restorer bring some structure in the complex decision making processes concerning the conservation of cultural heritage. One way to structure information is to compose an atlas; an image archive that helps the conservator-restorer recognize and identify those particularities that are decisive factors in the choice of an appropriate treatment or conservation strategy. In light of these developments, a wish for an image atlas of ultraviolet induced visible fluorescence phenomena (UV atlas) observed on paper artefacts has surfaced. This wish is mainly inspired by the conservation work field, since ultraviolet induced visible fluorescence (UVF(vis)) examination is a relatively rapid, non-destructive, simple and inexpensive technique that helps to survey large area’s and obtain valuable information about the composition of an object, its condition or its authenticity in a single glance. However, studies have shown that ultraviolet induced visible fluorescence images can be extremely difficult to interpret. As a result, a UV atlas might give the conservator-restorer a false sense of security the moment his or her findings match a given reference. Ultraviolet induced visible fluorescence images, in short, do not always give the unequivocal answers one might expect from an atlas.The purpose of this research was to define what it is that paper conservatorrestorers need in order to make use of the full potential of visual ultraviolet fluorescence examination in their daily practice. It further aimed to investigate if and how these needs can be met with an atlas or substantiated collection of ultraviolet induced visible fluorescence images arranged in a tabular form. This study involved a literature study that gave a clear overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the examination of paper artefacts using UVF(vis) in the field of conservation. In addition, the research involved an international online survey that gave a clear understanding of the use of visual ultraviolet fluorescence examination of paper artefacts in contemporary conservation practice was obtained. In comparing the conclusions of the literature review with those of the survey it was found that there is considerable variation in the conservator-restorers judgement and knowledge with regard to UVF(vis) examination, providing evidence that conservatorrestorers are not certain about how to use the technique. It was found that conservatorrestorers often lack the necessary routine in UVF(vis) examination in order to make use of the full potential of the technique. The research also found that conservator- restorers tend to use the technique indiscriminately as a sole means of identification which is in contradiction with conservation literature thus building a strong argument against an atlas of reference images and an argument in favour of an atlas as an educative tool, informing conservator-restorers of the limitations of UVF(vis) as well as its potential by presenting theoretical background as well as illustrative material and case-studies. Additionally it was found that an atlas should help development of an unambiguous and clear terminology describing UVF(vis) phenomena.},

	title = {Development of a micro-fading tester with near-{UV} capability},
	abstract = {This project was part of a continuing effort to further develop the micro-fading tester (MFT), a device that permits assessment of the light sensitivity of a colored artifact. The modified device allows for reproducible testing using light exposures that include the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. The central limitation in using the standard configuration of the MFT in this way is posed by the chromatic aberrations of the simple lenses used in delivering the light from the xenon lamp to the sample. Those aberrations cause the light to be focused slightly differently for different wavelengths, so the position of the fiberoptic tip alters the spectrum of light delivered to the sample. Delivering a light spectrum that includes the visible wavelengths as well as near-ultraviolet radiation requires determining the optimum position of the fiberoptic connector, and in identifying the spectrum of visible light (which is the range that can be detected with the typical spectrometer supplied with the system) that indicates this optimum position. In this project, a protocol was developed to describe how that adjustment can be done. In a second phase of the work, a new lamp system was designed and built using mirrors, which are free of chromatic aberrations, rather than the lenses in the standard system. This new source delivers light having a very reproducible spectrum that includes UV wavelengths, with no need for adjustments to tailor the spectrum. Consequently, the fading test results with this new MFT source, especially those performed with light spectra including the visible and UV, are much more reproducible and compare well with xenon fading tests performed in conventional exposure cabinets.},

	abstract = {A new approach to identifying artifacts sensitive to visible light exposure, based on the direct measurement of the lightfastness of materials that compose the object, is described. An instrument has been constructed that is capable of identifying fugitive materials (more light sensitive than Blue Wool \#2) rapidly and essentially nondestructively. Accelerated light-fading tests on tiny (0.4 mm diameter) areas of an object are done while simultaneously monitoring the color change produced in the test area. The lightfastness determined in such microfading tests has been found to compare well with that measured in more conventional accelerated lightaging tests. The risks of damage to the artifacts from these microfading tests have been examined. By terminating the fading test when a small but definite color change has been produced, the risk of disfiguring the object by creating a visible bleached spot is judged to be very small. Exposure to the light intensities used in the microfading tester can heat test areas to as high as 50°C, so that low-melting materials such as waxes should be considered at risk of some degree of melting damage. For most art materials that are more heat tolerant, however, this technique holds great promise as a tool for recognizing very light-sensitive materials and for 'predicting the consequences of exhibition under particular lighting or atmospheric conditions.},

Accelerated test methods are discussed, with emphasis on light stability tests specified with past and current ANSI and ISO Standards, future ISO Standards, and the “de facto” test method standards now widely used in the imaging industry, such as the predictive “Display Permanence Rating” test method developed by Wilhelm Imaging Research and the predictive stability test methods employed by Eastman Kodak for evaluation of Kodak Ultima Picture Paper (ColorLast, 2003 type). Light stability data for representative products evaluated with these two “de facto” test methods are given, and the major factors that account for the large differences in outcomes are presented. The potentially large impact of reciprocity failures in high-intensity accelerated light stability tests is illustrated with long-term test data for an inkjet paper printed with dye-based inks. The importance of the selection of the spectral power distribution of the illumination source employed for accelerated light stability tests is emphasized.},

	abstract = {Accelerated light stability tests employ high-intensity illumination sources to speed the fading process and have been based on the assumption that light fading and light-induced staining reactions follow the reciprocity law; that is, for equivalent klux/hour light exposures, the amount of fading, changes in color balance, and development of d-min stain will be the same in accelerated light stability tests employing high-intensity illumination (e.g., 35 klux for 24 hours per day) as it is under low-level, ambient display conditions (e.g., 450 lux for 12 hours per day) as long as the temperature and relative humidity conditions are the same in both cases. In this ongoing, long-term study, reciprocity behavior is evaluated using high-intensity 35 klux illumination and lower-intensity 1.0 klux fluorescent illumination. Both test environments are maintained at 24°C and 60\% RH. Dye-based and pigmented inks printed on various types of inkjet photo media are included, along with representative traditional color and black-and-white photographic prints made with RC (polyethylene resin-coated paper) supports. Potential problems in the design of reciprocity behavior tests for inkjet materials and interpretation of data from these tests are discussed.},

For translucent samples, there is a paucity of published results and the approaches are disparate. Accordingly, a review of K-M theory and its application for predicting the spectral reflectance factor of translucent samples is presented and tested. Four methods for determining the absorption and scattering coefficients with respect to a certain film thickness are described: the black-white method, the infinite method, the masstone-tint method, and the two-region method. The black-white and infinite methods use the general form of the K-M equation. The masstone-tint method can be used for both the general form and the opaque simplification. The two-region method, combining opaque and translucent approaches, was enhanced in this research and included an opacity calculation to automatically differentiate opaque and translucent spectral regions and a smoothing technique to combine both spectral regions. The two-region method was tested using a set of acrylic-emulsion artist paints and glazes spanning a range of opacities from opaque to nearly transparent. The results were reasonable and provided statistically significant improvement compared with the opaque simplification, commonly used in art conservation science and industrial color matching.},

A new spectral reconstruction method, called the matrix R method, was developed to reconstruct spectral reflectance factor accurately while simultaneously achieving high colorimetric performance for a defined illuminant and observer. The method combines the benefits of both colorimetric and spectral transformations. Tristimulus values were predicted by a colorimetric transformation from multi-channel camera signals, while spectral reflectance factor was estimated by a spectral transformation from the same signals. The method reconstructed reflectance factor by combining the fundamental stimulus from the predicted tristimulus values with the metameric black from the estimated spectral reflectance, based on the Wyszecki hypothesis. The experimental results verified the new method as a promising technique for building a spectral image database.},

It is a sequel to the previous work presented in [2], where the principle of moisture sorption stabilization was explained. Sorption isotherm investigations and EMC control implementation in historical buildings not provided with heating are the main concern in this paper. The proposed microclimate adjustment consists in leaving the interior temperature to run almost its spontaneous yearly cycle, while the air humidity is maintained in a specific relationship to the current interior temperature. The interior air humidity is modestly adjusted to protect historical exhibits and art works from harmful variations in the content of absorbed moisture, which would otherwise arise owing to the interior temperature drifts. Since direct measurements of moisture content are not feasible, the air humidity is controlled via a model-based principle. Two long-term implementations of the proposed microclimate control have already proved that it can permanently maintain a constant moisture content in the preserved exhibits.},

Eleven of these scrapbooks were chosen for public presentation as a supplemental element in the exihibition ‘‘Barbara Gamble: Natural Affinities.’’ Due to the known light sensitivity of many herbarium specimens, the pristine condition, and the value of the collection, it was necessary to determine the expected fading during exhibition. Light sensitivity of various elements of the scrapbooks were determined using the Oriel Microfade Tester. These elements include flower petals, algae, leaves, insects, inks, and crayons. Of the 89 locations tested, approximately 65\% were categorized as having high sensitivity to light, and the remainder have medium sensitivity. Among the most sensitive are the orange moth, inscription inks, and pink and blue flower petals. Based on these results, six pages of the scrapbook that do not contain highly light-sensitive elements were chosen for the exhibit.},

Chromium-based pigments such as lead chromate (PbCrO4, chrome yellow) or zinc chromate (K2O·4ZnCrO4·3H2O, zinc yellow), as used by Van Gogh and Seurat, currently exhibit substantial darkening in paintings such as “Sunflowers” or “A Sunday on La Grande Jatte-1884”. Winsor \& Newton (W\&N), one of the leading artists' colourmen of the time, has made its recipe archive available. Access to their extensive chrome yellow pigment formulations prompted our research on the stability of these pigments by reconstructing their processes of manufacture. The colorants obtained were compared with contemporary tube paints from W\&N as well as with samples from paintings by Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso (1887–1918) an influential modernist Portuguese painter. Good correlation between all three sources was found.},

	abstract = {The present paper describes the main results obtained from the characterization of a wide range of natural and synthetic ochre samples used in Portugal from the 19th to the 20th century, including powder and oil painting samples. The powder ochre samples came from several commercial distributors and from the collection of Joaquim Rodrigo (1912–1997), a leading Portuguese artist, particularly active during the sixties and seventies. The micro-samples of oil painting tubes came from the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea-Museu do Chiado (National Museum of Contemporary Art-Chiado Museum) in Lisbon and were used by Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (1857–1929), one of the most prominent naturalist Portuguese painters. These tubes were produced by the main 19th century colourmen: Winsor \& Newton, Morin et Janet, Maison Merlin, and Lefranc. The samples have been studied using μ-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (μ-FTIR), Raman microscopy, μ-Energy Dispersive X-ray fluorescence (μ-EDXRF), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The analyzed ochres were found to be a mixture of several components: iron oxides and hydroxides in matrixes with kaolinite, gypsum and chalk. The results obtained allowed to identify and characterize the ochres according to their matrix and chromophores. The main chromophores where identified by Raman microscopy as being hematite, goethite and magnetite. The infrared analysis of the ochre samples allowed to divide them into groups, according to the composition of the matrix. It was possible to separate ochres containing kaolinite matrix and/or sulfate matrix from ochres where only iron oxides and/or hydroxides were detected. μ-EDXRF and Raman were the best techniques to identify umber, since the presence of elements such as manganese is characteristic of these pigments. μ-EDXRF also revealed the presence of significant amounts of arsenic in all Sienna tube paints.},

The method developed gives reliable results with a well-defined degree of precision and allows confident prediction of the time it will take for light-induced colour changes to become visible. It uses an integrating head both to focus intense illumination onto selected sampling areas and to allow reflectance spectra to be recorded at desired intervals using a dual-beam spectrophotometer, thereby overcoming the chief sources of uncertainty associated with the alternative techniques considered (relocation, exposure, precision of data). Data are converted to CIELAB coordinates. Changes in the principal components of colour (lightness, hue and chroma) are monitored as a function of exposure, as well as the overall CIE94 colour change. All uncertainties are derived directly from the (normally distributed and random) uncertainty in reflectance spectra and not simply from data clusters. The technique is being used to determine the lightfastness of the Bullerswood carpet, designed by William Morris, which will feature in the Victoria \& Albert Museum's new galleries dedicated to British art and design.},

	abstract = {The Winsor \& NewtonTM (W\&N) nineteenth century archive database includes digitised images of hand-written instructions and workshop notes for the manufacture of their artists’ materials. For the first time, all 183 production records for yellow lead chromate pigments were studied and evaluated. They revealed that W\&N produced essentially three pigment types: lemon/pale based on mixed crystals of lead chromate and lead sulphate [Pb(Cr,S)O4]; middle on pure monoclinic lead chromate [PbCrO4]; and deep that contains the latter admixed with basic lead chromate [Pb2CrO5]; accounting for 53, 22, and 21\% of the production, respectively. Production records for primrose (4\%) were also included since the formulation results in mixed crystals with a high percentage of lead sulphate, which, according to the literature, leaves it more prone to degradation. Each pigment type is characterised by only one or two main synthetic pathways; process variations reveal a systematic and thorough search for a high-quality durable product. A comparison of the chemical composition of pigment reconstructions with early W\&N oil paint tubes showed that their records entitled ‘pale’ and ‘lemon’ correlated with the pigment in their tube labelled chrome yellow and, ‘middle’ and ‘deep’ with the label chrome deep. Lemon and middle pigment formulations were made into oil paints to assess their relative photo-stability. The degradation process was followed by colorimetry and was studied by synchrotron radiation-based techniques. Based on the X-ray absorption spectroscopy data, the possibility for creating a stability index for chrome yellows is discussed.},

We achieve strong absorption even away from the excitonic absorption pole. We explain the angle-dependent perfect absorption by comparing radiative and nonradiative damping rates for different incident angles. Moreover, we achieve large PL enhancement at strong light absorption conditions. This demonstrates that the absorbed light energy in excitonic perfect absorbers can be retrieved, unlike other perfect absorbers based on metal nanostructures where the absorbed energy is mainly dissipated as heat due to ohmic losses. Excitonic perfect absorbers can be useful for energy conversion devices or fluorescence-based optical devices.},

@mastersthesis{zweifel_exploring_2015,
	title = {Exploring the {Role} of the {Substrate} in the {Fading} and {Reversion} behaviour of {Prussian} {Blue} {Dye}},
	abstract = {The pigment Prussian blue (ferric ferrocyanide) is known to exhibit phototropic behaviour due to its isotropic structure. Under prolonged exposure to light or in the absence of oxygen, Prussian blue will fade to Prussian white as its ferric iron is reduced to the lower oxidation state of ferrous iron. The compound will revert back to Prussian blue when re-exposed to dark, ambient conditions. While the fading and reversion mechanism of Prussian blue dye is largely understood, these behaviors are complicated by environmental conditions, by the presence of production additives, as well as by the substrate upon which it is suffused. For example, it remains undetermined if a proteinaceous substrate might influence the reduction-oxidation reaction of Prussian blue differently than would a cellulosic substrate. This is particularly important in the case of Prussian blue dye, which was of common use during the nineteenth century. Determining the degree and rate of colour change of Prussian blue dye on different substrates will yield significant information that could help refine more specific display guidelines for artifacts, as well as quantify the risks involved in the anoxic treatment of Prussian blue textiles. This study analysed the role of the substrate in the fading and reversion of Prussian blue dye by measuring the degree and rate of Prussian blue fading and reversion across samples of different substrates (cotton and silk). Samples were exposed to light using a microfade tester under ambient conditions as well as under anoxia. A second set of samples was exposed over a twenty-day period under regular and anoxic conditions in an LED light chamber at 100 klux. The colour change of these samples was measured using a portable spectrophotometer. Under ambient conditions, silk samples exposed to both LED light and to microfade testing were found to exhibit significantly greater overall colour change than cotton samples. The substrate was found to be a less significant variable in the fading of Prussian blue dye under anoxic conditions. Finally, the experiment demonstrated a discrepancy in results between silk samples exposed to microfading and silk samples exposed in the LED light chamber, suggesting that the intensity of the light source has an effect on the reduction behaviour of Prussian blue on silk (rather than overall dosage alone). This is a significant factor to consider if constructing future experiments that seek to mimic museum exhibition lighting conditions.},

Ethnographic collections were used as a case study because they contain a diverse range of such materials, and are usually more impure as a result of less processing. Deterioration occurring by means of oxidation mechanisms, which are believed to predominate from exposure to visible light, was studied through scientific investigation. Colour measurement and chemical analysis were used to evaluate the extent of damage resulting from accelerated ageing designed to simulate exhibition at illumination levels slightly higher than those usually specified. The results indicated a difference in trend and scale of reaction between impure and pure model materials. Conclusions are given here regarding lighting levels for cellulosic collections in order to maximise access while managing the small amount of damage that must inevitably occur.},

The text discusses the role of the carbonyl and azo groups in ketones and azoalkanes in the development of photochemistry, followed by a review of nucleophilic substitution reactions in the photochemistry of aromatics (also called photosubstitution) and the various atomic bonds that result from these reactions. The book presents studies that explain the factors that govern the nature and efficiencies of SET-promoted photochemical reactions. It then focuses on photoamination as a convenient, powerful, and environmentally friendly synthetic process for transforming a variety of substrates into the corresponding aminated compounds. The final chapter explores how dye structure affects the sequence-dependence of DNA binding, which has potential applications in nonlinear optics and DNA detection as well as incorporating DNA into various nanostructures and devices. With an emphasis on the current uses of light in both materials chemistry and medicinal chemistry, this book serves as a comprehensive resource on photochemical reactions and discusses topics that are useful for researchers as well as newcomers in the fields of photochemistry, photobiology, photomedicine, and photophysics Instructors},

The numerical aperture of stereomicroscopes has continuously increased over the years, reaching the point where the lenses of left and right perspective paths touched each other. This constraint appeared as an upper limit for the resolution of stereomicroscopes, as the resolution of a stereomicroscope was deduced from the numerical apertures of the two equally sized perspective channels. We present the optical design and advances in resolution of the world's first asymmetrical stereomicroscope, which is a technological breakthrough in many aspects of stereomicroscopes. This unique approach uses a large numerical aperture and thus an, so far, unachievable high lateral resolution in the one path, and a small aperture in the other path, which provides a high depth of field ("Fusion Optics"). This new concept is a technical challenge for the optical design of the zoom system as well as for the common main objectives. Furthermore, the new concept makes use of the particular way in which perspective information by binocular vision is formed in the human's brain. In conjunction with a research project at the University of Zurich, Leica Microsystems consolidated the functionality of this concept in to a new generation of stereomicroscopes.},

	abstract = {Reflectance spectral imaging is a powerful tool for the non-invasive study of cultural heritage objects. Particular visible to short wave infrared (400–2500 nm) spectral features are linked to compositional information. Spectral images can hence be used to generate useful chemical maps. However, in the case of complex mixtures, the global shape of reflectance spectra of pure materials can be affected by the presence of other absorbing materials. While studying heterogeneous polychromatic surfaces in which the same material is found in different color preparations (hence presenting different global absorption characteristics), this aspect can strongly affect the success of the targeted chemical mapping. As a result, several spectral processing steps are necessary to overcome the presence of interfering materials. The case study of the Codex Borbonicus, a precious 16th century Aztec manuscript, is reported herein. Visible and short-wave infrared reflectance images of the document were scanned in situ. To obtain material specific mappings that are not affected by the presence of pigment mixtures, the necessity of applying particular spectral treatments is shown. The flaws and qualities of the resulting chemical images are discussed, along with their general potential for cultural heritage case studies. In summary, independent macroscopic chemical maps of cochineal lake, gypsum, and palygorskite (the clay that composes the mineral matrix of the famous Maya Blue pigment) on the pages of the manuscript were successfully obtained.},

Typically, tints are prepared of each colorant mixed with titanium dioxide white at a number of levels in addition to the colorant by itself, the “masstone.” The tint recipes must be determined accurately, applied uniformly to a support until opacity is achieved, and measured with a reflection spectrophotometer. Given the large number of colorants used in inpainting, database development requires a considerable time commitment. Accordingly, it was of interest to determine the minimum number of samples required to characterize a colorant’s optical properties. Two optical models were considered, two-constant Kubelka-Munk (K-M) turbid media theory and its single-constant simplification. This was tested using four acrylic emulsion paints with a range of absorption and scattering properties: cobalt blue, cadmium yellow medium, green gold (a three-pigment mixture), and phthalocyanine green. For colorant selection, a single tint, preferably near the maximum chroma achievable by mixing with white, was sufficient. For both colorant selection and recipe prediction, two-constant K-M theory was required; in this case, a single tint preferably near the maximum chroma and the masstone were sufficient. Additionally, the effect of accounting for the refractive index discontinuity between air and the paint film was considered, known as the “Saunderson correction,” and found to be important in order to achieve best performance.},

	title = {Historically accurate reconstructions of {Amadeo}'s chrome yellows: an integrated study of their manufacture and stability},
	abstract = {The subject of this PhD is the study of 19 th century yellow chromate pigments, in particular chrome yellow (lead chromate), which has been frequently found in the paintings by the Portuguese Modern painter Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso (1887-1918) and by Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890). Detailed knowledge of the materials used by artists is fundamental for the understanding of their technique and to place their works in context as well as to determine the state of preservation and authenticity of their work. For this thesis new knowledge was gained through a multidisciplinary approach which combines art technological and conservation science research. This is the first doctoral work that fully explores the Winsor \& Newton (W\&N) 19 th Century Archive Database and provides a unique insight into the company’s choices and workshop practices. W\&N had a special concern for the quality and durability of their yellow chromate pigments. A complete evaluation of their 286 production records for yellow chromate pigments was undertaken. The majority of the production records (64\%) pertain to different hues of lead chromate. W\&N produced essentially three lead chromate pigment types: Lemon/Pale based on mixed crystals of lead chromate and lead sulfate [PbCr 1-x S x O 4 ] where x ≤ 0.4; Middle based on pure monoclinic lead chromate [PbCrO 4 ]; and Deep that contains the latter admixed with basic lead chromate [Pb 2 CrO 5 ]. Production records for the manufacture of barium chromate, BaCrO 4 (25\%), zinc potassium chromate, 4ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O·3H 2 O (9\%), and strontium chromate, SrCrO 4 (2\%) were also found. Despite the high number of production records, each chromate pigment type is characterised by only one or two main synthetic pathways. W\&N’s addition of extenders in their lead chromate pigment formulations, indicates that they were mainly used to adjust pigment properties and not as a means to decrease costs. The reduced number of records found for the production of the light-sensitive Primrose type of lead chromate (a formulation composed of sulfur-rich PbCr 1-x S x O 4 ), and strontium chromate, suggests W\&N was not manufacturing or selling these pigment formulations on a large scale; more evidence that during the 19 th century W\&N was committed to primarily selling high quality durable chromate pigments.},

To reach this goal it is necessary to achieve sufficient spectral and colorimetric accuracies of both the spectral imaging system and pigment mapping. The output is a series of spatial distributions of pigments (or pigment maps) composing a painting. With these pigment maps, the change of the color appearance of the painting can be simulated when the optical properties of one or more pigments are altered. These pigment maps will also be beneficial for enriching the historical knowledge of the painting and aiding conservators in determining the best course for retouching damaged areas of the painting when metamerism is a factor.},

In this study the prediction of the color of coral glazes obtained by addition of hematite-zircon pigment (Fe2O3–ZrSiO4) in an opaque glaze was carried out with the Kubelka–Munk model. Subsequent to the physical and chemical characterization of the glaze components (frit, opacifier and pigments), the color prediction was performed with the simplified Kubelka–Munk model proposed for zircon pigments. In particular was verified if this model is also valid in the case of pigment Fe2O3–ZrSiO4 where the hematite is encapsulated by the zircon structure. Three glazes were prepared to determine the absorption optical constants from the reflectance curves measured with a spectrophotometer. The results obtained with the simplified model were in good agreement with the experimental reflectance curves and the prediction of coral color was possible with a reduced number of experiments.},

To this end, an innovative inversed mathematical evaluation procedure was concocted which comprised of plotting the absorption and scattering constants of the Kubelka–Munk model or any of its various modified form or replacements theories against the intrinsic optical coefficients of the respective exact radiation transfer theories, namely Chandrasekhar for opaque and van de Hulst for translucent media. The results prove mathematically that the Kubelka–Munk model for opaque media is a sound theory and its various suggested modifications or replacements do not improve the color match prediction of opaque surface coating media. This mathematical conclusion was further confirmed by color match prediction of actual opaque paint samples. On the other hand, the mathematical prediction for translucent media illustrated a completely different picture, depicting nonlinearity between the optical constants and the respective concentrations of colorants. This implies that much further work has to be carried out to derive invertible new equations to enforce linearity to such situations or make use of alternative artificial intelligent procedures which are designed especially for nonlinearity.},

	abstract = {Paper‐based heritage objects on exhibition are typically framed using a transparent glazing material such as glass or acrylic. This often makes the task of measuring their light fastness a difficult one since cultural institutions may have unframing restrictions, especially for large‐format objects. However, a testing programme recently conducted at the National Museum in Krakow has revealed that in certain cases it is possible to obtain colorant stability information directly from a framed object. Microfading testing results are reliable if the distance from the object to the protective glazing is adequate to allow proper illumination and collection of reflected light. This paper presents a case study of six large‐format pastels on paper by Stanisław Wyspiański, one of the most outstanding and versatile artists at the turn of the twentieth century in Poland. Some of the orange and pink areas showed higher sensitivity to light with fading rates that remain within the Blue Wool 1–2 range. The objects have been classified according to the light sensibility of their colorants, and this information has allowed development and implementation of exhibition guidelines that serve to minimise the degradation associated with museum illumination. In addition, scientific imaging, microfading data and computer analysis of the images have allowed virtual representation of the potential colour changes that these artworks may experience as a result of uncontrolled and long exposure to gallery illumination.},

	abstract = {The darkening due to chemical alteration of chrome yellows (PbCrO4/PbCr1–xSxO4) is a phenomenon threatening a large number of 19th–20th century paintings, including the Amsterdam Sunflowers by Vincent van Gogh. Our earlier studies have proven that the alteration is due to a Cr(VI) → Cr(III) reduction with Cr(V)-species that are formed as long-lived intermediates and that PbCr1–xSxO4 (0 {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextless x ≤ 0.8) types undergo reduction more readily than monoclinic, S-free, PbCrO4. In this context, there is still lack of knowledge about the effects of the chemical properties of the binding medium (i.e., chemical composition and drying process) and the solubility of chrome yellows on the overall reduction pathways. Here, we study a series of naturally and photochemically aged mock-up paints prepared by mixing chrome yellow powders (PbCrO4/PbCr0.2S0.8O4) with either linseed oil or a water-based acrylic emulsion as the binding medium. Equivalent paints made up of the highly soluble K2CrO4 were also investigated and used as benchmarks to provide a more in-depth understanding of the influence of the solubility on the chromate reduction pathways in the two different binders. A combination of synchrotron radiation-based Cr K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and UV–Visible spectroscopy measurements shows that: (1) the Cr(VI) reduction results from the interaction between the pigment and the binder; (2) the process is more significant in oil, giving rise to Cr(V)- and Cr(III)-species as well as oxidized organic compounds; (3) the lightfastness of the chrome yellow pigment is enhanced in the acrylic binder; and (4) the tendency toward chromium reduction increases with increasing solubility of the pigment. Based on our findings, we propose a scheme for the mechanism of the (photo)reduction process of chrome yellows in the oil and acrylic binder. Overall, our results provide new insights into the factors driving the degradation of lead chromate-based paints in artworks and contribute to the development of strategies for preserving them over time.},

The question investigated in this chapter is whether there is a substantial colour difference between the digital reproductions of the artefacts downloaded from several online databases and the original works. Tests and measurements aimed to explore the reasons for the differences, which were detected and are described. Six paintings were selected for detailed investigation. Representative coloured patches were measured on these reproductions from the internet, displaying them in three popular web browsers, and the data sets were compared. Results from this research demonstrate that there are significant differences between the original artefacts and their digital reproductions, and there is a significant difference between the different web browsers. The source of this difference is very complex. One is the difference between the displaying techniques of the various web browsers, which produces a relevant aberration in colour rendering. This consequence can arise from the JPEG encoding and decoding methods. Implicit use of colour spaces in browsers, missing or incorrect EXIF data, and noncalibrated displays together can result in very different forms of colour representation},

Definitions of basic terms such as aging, degradation, and stability have notes appended relating to specific cases. Thus, for example, definitions of different types of aging (such as artificial, cosmic, ground, or radiation aging) are covered by notes under the general term "aging".

	abstract = {Spectral imaging has been widely developed over the last ten years for archiving cultural heritage. It can retrieve spectral reflectance of each scene pixel and provide the possibility to render images for any viewing condition. A new spectral reconstruction method, the matrix R method, can achieve high spectral and colorimetric accuracies simultaneously for a specific viewing condition. Although the matrix R method is very effective, the reconstructed reflectance spectrum is not smooth when compared with in situ spectrophotometry. The goal of this research was to smooth the spectrum and make it more accurate. One possible solution is to identify pigments and find their compositions for each pixel. After that, the reflectance spectrum can be modified based on two-constant Kubelka-Munk theory using the absorption and scattering coefficients of these pigments, weighted by their concentrations. The concentrations were optimized to best fit the spectral reflectance predicted by the matrix R method. As a preliminary experiment, it was assumed that a custom target was painted using several known pigments. The simulation results show that incorporating pigment mapping into the matrix R method can recover the smoothness of the reflectance spectrum, and further improve spectral accuracy of spectral imaging. Introduction Traditional colorimetric devices acquire only three samples, critically under-sampling spectral information and suffering from metamerism. Alternatively, spectral devices increase the number of samples and can reconstruct spectral information for each scene pixel. Retrieved spectral information can be used to render color images for any viewing condition. Spectral imaging has been widely developed over the last ten years for archiving culture heritage at a number of institutes worldwide. Three spectral acquisition systems have been developed and tested in our laboratory. Recently, the matrix R method was proposed and implemented for spectral imaging reconstruction. The method followed the Wyszecki hypothesis where a spectrum can be decomposed into a fundamental stimulus and a metameric black. The spectral reflectance and tristimulus values were both calculated from multichannel camera signals. Then the hybrid spectral reflectance was generated by combing the fundamental stimulus and metameric black predicted from tristimulus values and spectral reflectance, respectively. This method achieved high spectral and colorimetric accuracies simultaneously for a certain viewing condition. The spectral accuracy of this method was mainly determined by the estimated spectral reflectance, which was calculated by multiplying the multi-channel camera signals with a transformation matrix. Each column of the transformation matrix can be estimated by a basis vector, and spectral reflectance can be represented as a linear combination of these basis vectors, weighted by the multi-channel camera signals. A transformation matrix for a six-channel virtual camera is shown in Figure 1. Due to the wavelike shape of the basis vectors, the predicted spectral reflectance for a white patch, for examples, is not as flat as in situ spectrophotometry, shown in Figure 2. The goal of this research was to smooth reflectance spectra and to further improve spectral accuracy. 360 460 560 660 760 −300 −200 −100 0 100 200 300 Wavelength (nm) B as is V ec to r Figure 1.

A tentative relation of the change in Y value (δY) with steps in the standard geometric gray scale (BS2662) is noted.

The quantitative use of thermography allows an effective investigation of the decay and identification of the causes of the material weakness. Furthermore, the knowledge of the hidden history of the monument is enhanced by a view in the IR. Thermal Non Destructive Testing could analyse different works of art and decay forms.

Optical microscopy, colorimetry, spectrofluorimetry, micro-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to characterize the physicochemical changes induced to the pigments. Change of crystalline phase was identified for vermilion while reduction processes take place for lead chromate and malachite. It was found that these effects were minimized by application of ultraviolet ultrashort pulses (of femtosecond and picosecond duration) as compared with changes occurring by pulsed infrared irradiation (of both picosecond and nanosecond duration). The results presented are discussed in relation to previous research on painted mock-ups in order to elucidate the role and significance of the binding media in the laser induced discoloration of painted surfaces and thus to propose optimum laser cleaning practices.},

The goal of the present study was to test if this result holds in real viewing conditions, i.e., with real paintings and real light sources. The same 11 paintings were tested in real conditions illuminated by a spectrally tunable light source and with accurate monitor simulations. To ensure uniform illumination across the paintings, only a central part of the paintings was visible to the observers. It was found that the average CCT preferred for real and monitor viewing conditions were very similar, 5500 and 5700 K, respectively. The somewhat larger CCT obtained with monitor viewing in relation to the former study was only observed in some paintings and was attributed to the smaller viewing area. These results confirm that CCT for best appreciation of paintings is higher than normally used in museums, and the viewing conditions, real or simulated, have only a minor effect.},

	abstract = {A strategy is reported to optimize lighting to reduce photochemical degradation of works of art and archival documents. The strategy revolves around improving luminous efficiency of the spectral profile to exclude light which doesn't contribute to brightness or color perception, while also trying to maintain color rendering. The work focuses on Old Master Drawings and designing filters for illuminants, but is applicable to the broad range of art and archival documents and the direct design of lighting without filters such as LED. A filter profile is identified which seems to be beneficial, or at worst neutral for all pigments measured. Underlying principles are identified: (1) The best luminous efficiencies arise from multiple band illuminants, and also improves as color rendering is sacrificed. (2) Protection of an object even late in its damage life can significantly extend its remaining life. (3) Protection of an object early in its life can possibly abate some of the light induced damage it may experience across its life, so early intervention in light protection may be advised. This report further goes on to suggest approaches to further enhance the protection, including tailoring the spectral dependence of appearance change. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	volume = {39},
	doi = {10.1179/019713600806082720},
	abstract = {Many types of museum exhibits are susceptible to damage caused by exposure to light, and current recommendations for museum lighting include avoidance of nonvisible radiant power (UV and IR), limitation of illumination level, and restriction of exposure duration. However, these recommendations do not distinguish between the potential of incident radiant power in the visible spectrum to stimulate the sense of brightness (illuminance) and its potential to cause damage (irradiance).This article investigates the notion that the visual satisfaction provided by incandescent sources could be matched with significantly less irradiance by illumination composed of three spectral bands corresponding to red, green, and blue light. Pairs of identical artworks were displayed in two adjacent simulated art galleries, and 16 subjects adjusted the illumination in the test gallery to match the appearance of the similar display in the comparison gallery. The light source in the comparison gallery was an MR tungsten halogen display spotlight of either low (2850 K) or intermediate (4200 K) color temperature. The light source in the test gallery was either an identical MR spotlight, or it was an experimental three-band source of far lesser irradiance for which the color temperature had been matched to that in the comparison gallery.It was found that, when instructed to adjust for equality of appearance, the subjects set for equality of illuminance. For this condition, the irradiance of the artworks was significantly less for the three-band source than for either of the MR lamps. Also, at equal illuminance and color temperatures, subjects' responses indicated that they were conscious of differences in appearance between the three-band source and the MR lamps, but the difference seemed slight and they did not necessarily discriminate against the three-band source. It is concluded that a practical light source for museums could be developed that would have the potential to equal the visual satisfaction provided by incandescent lamps at a given illuminance, while exposing exhibits to significantly less irradiance, thus reducing their rate of degradation while on display.},

	abstract = {This Part VI is a progress report, with two motivations. (1) To publish the new method of extraction of weighting functions, and to show the demonstrated large reduction of tristimulus error in an array of ten disparate visually-matching pairs of white lights, and (2) to attempt to interest others in joining the work. The direct extraction of improved weighting functions (WFs) from an array of visually matching pairs of white lights is the subject of Part VI. This new approach is made necessary by our finding (Part I) that color-matching functions by either the Maxwell method or by the maximum saturation method lead to large errors (discrepancies) in computed chromaticities of pairs of visually-matching lights. Using spectral power distributions (SPDs) of 5 types from Part IV, eight observers make 5 strongly metameric visual matches to the same broadband reference white light, with 1.3° visual field and 70 cd/m2 luminance of the reference white. Each of the resulting 5 SPDs is averaged over the 8 observers, and the 5 averaged SPDs are formed into 10 pairs (the five averaged visually-matching lights taken two at a time). Tristimulus values X, Y, and Z are computed for each member of each pair by the CIE 1931 weighting functions (color-matching functions) x, y, and z. Absolute ΔX, the tristimulus error (the difference between computed X1 and X2 of the visually-matching lights), is computed for each pair and summed over the 10 pairs, as are ΔY and ΔZ. The often-large 10-pair total tristimulus error TTE is computed for X, Y, or Z. For example TTEX is the sum of the ten absolute ΔX's of the 10 pairs. Then x is progressively altered in spectral shape by an algorithm that on each iteration reduces TTEX. Weighting functions y and z are altered in turn. Reduction to 1–3\%, of the TTE initially associated with the CIE weighting function, is achieved in this preliminary work. The changes in shape of the resulting functions are discussed. The simpler term “weighting function” is used rather than “color-matching function” for these, and it is recognized that, when finally correct, these functions should represent the three spectral sensitivities of the normal human visual system. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {The objectives of this article are (1) to help reestablish in technical thinking the three spectral sensitivity curves, dating from Helmholtz, of the normal human visual system (particularly their peak wavelengths); (2) to remind the reader of the principles of the sets of three color-matching functions (CMFs) comprising a CIE Standard Observer, and to make these principles more easily understandable; (3) to show how the visual data comprising today's Standard Observers lead directly to the peak wavelengths of the spectral sensitivity curves; (4) to use modern color-matching data to restore essential details to CMFs damaged by manipulation over the years; (5) to suggest that coincidence of corrected CMFs and the actual spectral sensitivities of the normal human visual system (a feature long tacitly assumed by color scientists of the past) is close at hand; and (7) to point out that CMFs embody a wealth of significance concerning the nature of the spectral response of the normal human visual system, despite the fact that they do not work well as weighting functions in the practice of colorimetry. The color-matching data of the CIE 1964 10° Standard Observer are used to reproduce the visual matches upon which it is based, and to model the principles of CMFs in general. The CIE 1964 data are treated as if they had been collected directly from modern-day visual matching experiments, in which an accurate, high-resolution, absolute spectral power distribution (SPD) of every viewed light is measured, and power content of each component of the light determined. The experimental units and dimensions of the resulting three CMFs are established. The significance of CMF plots above and below the zero-power level, and of the spectral shapes of the CMFs, is shown. The positions in wavelength of the nominal maximum of the red, green, and blue CMF, for a wide range of wavelengths of real spectral primaries, are noted (following MacAdam) to be “amazingly similar.” Then the much-manipulated data of the CIE Standard Observers are left behind, and modern raw unmanipulated visual data are analyzed in the same manner. The results yield characteristics of CMFs that are more representative of the normal human visual system than are those of the CIE Standard Observers. The peak heights of the nominal maxima of the red, green, and blue CMF, for the same wide range of primaries, are importantly significant also. They serve to define, at least approximately, the forms of the three spectral sensitivities, assuming the traditional model of the visual system. © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {The use of colorimetry within industry has grown extensively in the last few decades. Central to many of today's instruments is the CIE system, established in 1931. Many have questioned the validity of the assumptions made by Wright1 and Guild,2 some suggesting that the 1931 color-matching functions are not the best representation of the human visual system's cone responses. A computational analysis was performed using metameric data to evaluate the CIE 1931 color-matching functions as compared to with other responsivity functions. The underlying assumption was that an optimal set of responsivity functions would yield minimal color-difference error between pairs of visually matched metamers. The difference of average color differences found in the six chosen sets of responsivity functions was small. The CIE 1931 2° color-matching functions on average yielded the largest color difference, 4.56 ΔE. The best performance came from the CIE 1964 10° color-matching functions, which yielded an average color difference of 4.02 ΔE. An optimization was then performed to derive a new set of color-matching functions that were visually matched using metameric pairs of spectral data. If all pairs were to be optimized to globally minimize the average color difference, it is expected that this would produce an optimal set of responsivity functions. The optimum solution was to use a weighted combination of each set of responsivity functions. The optimized set, called the Shaw and Fairchild responsivity functions, was able to reduce the average color difference to 3.92 ΔE. In the final part of this study a computer-based simulation of the color differences between the sets of responsivity functions was built. This simulation allowed a user to load a spectral radiance or a spectral reflectance data file and display the tristimulus match predicted by each of the seven sets of responsivity functions. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate visual performance during reading under different illumination sources. Methods: This experimental quantitative study included 40 (20 females and 20 males) emmetropic participants with no history of ocular pathology. The participants were randomly assigned to read a near visual task under four different illuminations (400-lux constant): compact fluorescent light (CFL), tungsten light (TUNG), fluorescent tube light (FLUO), and light emitting diode (LED). Subsequently, we evaluated the participants’ experiences of eight symptoms of visual comfort. Results: The mean age of the participants was 19.86 ± 1.09 (range: 18–21) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the reading rates of males and females under the different illuminations (P = 0.99); however, the reading rate was fastest among males under CFL, and among females under FLUO. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a strong significant difference (P = 0.001) between males and females (P = 0.002) regarding the visual performance and illuminations. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the influence of illumination on reading rate; there were no significant differences between males and females under different illuminations, however, males preferred CFL and females preferred FLUO for faster reading and visual comfort. Interestingly, neither preferred LED or TUNG. Although energy-efficient, visual performance under LED is poor; it is uncomfortable for prolonged reading and causes early symptoms of fatigue.},

The results of the measurements showed that the illumination levels of the Mimesis Art museum on the first floor were effectively controlled to display the art works. The illumination levels on the third floor, however, were much higher than recommended illumination values for museum because of less controlled natural light. Therefore, more considerations to control the natural light are needed to secure stable environment in the exhibition spaces. Meanwhile, the answers of questionnaires concerning the quality of lighting conditions in the Mimesis Art Museum showed that the natural light was so effective to light the museum although the natural light illuminated some areas of the museum with high illumination levels.},

The structure was not originally designed to house a museum collection since it contains numerous openings such as windows, doors and skylights, which provide a path for natural radiation to enter the building and come in contact with the artworks. From a preventive conservation standpoint, this is an important problem since sensitive works of art in the collection may be subjected to damage caused by light exposure. Environmental data loggers installed throughout the museum were programmed to take successive measurements every 10min for 24h a day, 7days a week and 52weeks a year.

This study evaluates both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of lighting design in four museums. Psychological, physiological and experiential components are observed in these museums’ environments to analyze lighting design within its exhibits. My observations and knowledge gained by studying these museums help influence and enhance the design of the Cedar Hill Museum of History.},

This index enables statistical inferences not achievable by other metrics used commonly for performance evaluation. It was found that CIEDE2000 was statistically superior at a 95\% confidence level to either CIE94, the previous recommended equation by the CIE, or the simple Euclidean distance in CIELAB, ΔE*ab. Recent formulas based on the CIECAM02 color-appearance space and chroma-compressed variants of CIELAB were also evaluated and found to have only slightly reduced performance compared with CIEDE2000. These formulas have the advantage of simplicity and easier interpretation when used for quantifying color accuracy. Finally, each experimental dataset was evaluated separately rather than weight averaged as used during the development of CIEDE2000. Significant differences were found between datasets, suggesting that combining datasets may obscure important differences and that the practice of parameter optimization during formula development using combined data is likely suboptimal.},

This can cause errors of up to 35° in the case of stimuli of low luminance lying on the spectrum locus or purple line. Errorrs are unlikely to occur in the case of surface colors, but in the case of transparent object colors their frequency and magnitude are such as to make CIELAB unsuitable as a color space or as a color-difference formula whenever a tristimulus ratio is below the critical figure. Practical considerations suggest that in such cases the best solution is to use a modified Judd polynomial function, and this course is suggested for consideration by the CIE Colorimetry Committee and the committee responsible for developing an ISO Standard for the color measurement of plastics.},

From the combined dataset employed for the development of CIEDE2000, we found that the improvement of CIE94 over CIELAB was considerably greater than that of CIEDE2000 over CIE94. Chroma-difference correction was the most important correction in both CIE94 and CIEDE2000. With an arbitrary value of 100 assigned to this correction, the score of the hue-difference correction in CIE94 was 21, and the scores of the four remaining corrections in CIEDE2000 were as follows: hue difference, 29; rotation term, 8; lightness difference, 8; and gray correction, 6. At 95\% confidence level each of the corrections introduced in CIEDE2000 or CIE94 was statistically significant for the whole combined dataset, in agreement with the results reported by CIE TC 1-47 and 1-29. For the combined dataset, the differences between CMC and CIEDE2000 were found to be statistically significant at 95\% confidence level, but the differences between CMC and CIE94 were not. From subsets of the combined dataset it was concluded that further analyses of the lightness-difference and gray corrections proposed by CIEDE2000 would be desirable, using new experimental data.},

A new theory was devised, based on the assumption of a normal distribution of color differences in local areas of CIE 1931 chromaticity space. A likelihood function that combines the observer characteristic with the probability of a certain chromaticity point being seen as a match to a color center provides a mathematical description of color-difference perception in x, y space. Best estimates of the color-difference-perception-ellipse parameters and the value of a false-alarm-rate parameter are found by maximizing this likelihood function. Use of this function leads to predicted data that are not significantly different from collected visual data. The unit color-difference-perception ellipse thus calculated describes the locus of chromaticities that have approximately a 60\% chance of being seen as matches to the color represented by the center of the ellipse.},

The NCSU-B2 dataset comprised 65 textile substrates and a standard, with a mean \&\#x394;Eab* color difference of 2.72, ranging from 0.54\&\#x2013;5.72. Samples were visually assessed by 26 subjects against the reference gray scale in three separate trials with at least 24\&\#xA0;h between assessments. A total of 5070 assessments were obtained. The standardized residual sum of squares (STRESS) index was used to examine the performance of various formulas for this dataset, as well as a previously developed NCSU-B1 low-chroma blue dataset [Color Res. Appl.36, 27, 2011], and blue centers from other established visual datasets. Results show that formulas based on more recent uniform color spaces provide better agreement with perceptual data compared with models based on CIELAB space.},

The description of the exact starting composition of a wide collection of reference materials is preliminary to the study of the challenging photo-degradation processes in which most of the early synthetic dyes and pigments are involved. In this paper, four eosin-based lakes, all containing eosin Y, and one also containing eosin B, but differing in the organic and inorganic materials used as fillers, were fully characterized. These formulations were reconstructed on the base of historical recipes from the extensive Wiesel's collection, dated to the 19th century and bought by Dr Kremer (Kremer Pigmente, Germany) in the 1990s. The composition of each formulation was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and luminescence spectroscopy was used as a probe for their inert-distinction. Reference paint layers were then prepared by casting the lakes in linseed oil, and their ageing and impact on color change was monitored for one year by analyzing two sets of paint model systems by colorimetry. For each system, two sets were prepared and one was stored in the dark while the other exposed to natural light. The material distribution and homogeneity of the samples were tested by Synchrotron Radiation based micro infrared spectroscopy (SR-μ-FT-IR). Finally, an ultra-sensitive method based on Liquid Chromatography coupled with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), allowed us to characterize eosin degradation products detected but never identified before, and to evaluate their kinetics of formation.},

We recently demonstrated that different crystal forms of chrome yellow pigments (PbCrO4 and PbCr1–xSxO4) are present in paintings by Vincent van Gogh. In the present work, we show how both the chemical composition and the crystalline structure of lead chromate-based pigments influence their stability. For this purpose, oil model samples made with in-house synthesized powders of PbCrO4 and PbCr1–xSxO4 were artificially aged and characterized. We observed a profound darkening only for those paint models made with PbCr1–xSxO4, rich in SO42– (x ≥ 0.4), and orthorhombic phases ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextgreater30 wt \%). Cr and S K-edge micro X-ray absorption near edge structure investigations revealed in an unequivocal manner the formation of up to about 60\% of Cr(III)-species in the outer layer of the most altered samples; conversely, independent of the paint models’ chemical composition, no change in the S-oxidation state was observed. Analyses employing UV–visible diffuse reflectance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were performed on unaged and aged model samples in order to obtain additional information on the physicochemical changes induced by the aging treatment.},

	abstract = {Light-induced redox processes have been established as the cause of the chromatic alterations of a number of artists' pigments used from the 15th to the 20th century. Despite the fact that a general comprehension of the mechanisms has been provided through the characterization of photo-degraded compounds, both exhaustive information on the wavelength-dependence of the alteration process of the pigments and experimental evidence in how visible light may influence the formation pathways of specific secondary compounds are still lacking. Establishing an analytical protocol for the study of wavelength-dependence of pigments on photo-redox pathways is relevant for the safe illumination of paintings, especially in view of the possible use of spectrally tunable light sources such as white light emitting diodes (WLEDs). In this work, we propose an integrated approach based on a combination of diffuse reflectance UV-visible, synchrotron radiation (SR)-based micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF)/X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies to study the photo-redox process of Cr(VI) → Cr(III) for lead chromate yellows (PbCr1−xSxO4, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) under exposure to different monochromatic light. In view of the thin (3–5 μm) alteration layer that is formed at the paint surface after light exposure, SR-based Cr K-edge μ-XANES/μ-XRF analysis was employed to obtain information on the abundance, nature and distribution of the alteration of Cr(III)-compounds at the micrometric-scale level. On the other hand, EPR spectroscopy was used as a complementary tool to the SR-based X-ray methods due to its sensitivity for revealing species containing one or more unpaired electrons and for distinguishing different coordination geometries of paramagnetic centers, such as Cr(V)-species. Semi-quantitative indications about the darkening of the paint surface were obtained by UV-Vis spectroscopy. An abundance of reduced Cr down to around 50\% was detected at the aged surface of chrome yellow paints. The reduction process was favored not only by wavelengths shorter than 460 nm (i.e., where the pigment shows its maximum absorption) but also by light in the 490–530 nm range. The first evidence of the presence of Cr(V)-intermediates in the Cr(VI) → Cr(III) reduction reaction allowed the risks of inducing photo-degradation of the 490–530 nm wavelength range to be explained.},

	abstract = {A combination of synchrotron radiation (SR) micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) and XRF mode X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements at the Cr K-edge already allowed us to establish that the photo-reduction of chromates to Cr(III) compounds is the cause of darkening of chrome yellow pigments (PbCr1−xSxO4, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) in a number of paintings by Vincent van Gogh and in corresponding artificially aged paint models. A silicon drift detector (SDD) was employed to record the Cr-K XRF radiation in these X-ray micro beam-based measurements. However, in view of the limited count rate capabilities and collection solid angle of a single device, μ-XRF and μ-XANES employing single element SDDs (or similar) are primarily suited for collection of spectral data from individual points. Additionally, collection of XRF maps via point-by-point scanning with relatively long dwell times per point is possible but is usually confined to small areas. The development of the 384 silicon-diode array Maia XRF detector has provided valuable solutions in terms of data acquisition rate, allowing for full spectral (FS) XANES imaging in XRF mode, i.e., where spectroscopic information is available at each pixel in the scanned map. In this paper, the possibilities of SR Cr K-edge FS-XANES imaging in XRF mode using the Maia detector are examined as a new data collection strategy to study the speciation and distribution of alteration products of lead chromate-based pigments in painting materials. The results collected from two micro-samples taken from two Van Gogh paintings and an aged paint model show the possibility to perform FS-XANES imaging in practical time frames (from several minutes to a few hours) by scanning regions of sample sizes of the same order (more than 500 μm). The sensitivity and capabilities of FS-XANES imaging in providing representative chemical speciation information at the microscale (spatial resolution from ∼2 to 0.6 μm) over the entire scanned area are demonstrated by the identification of Cr(OH)3, Cr(III) sulfates and/or Cr(III) organometallic compounds in the corresponding phase maps, as alteration products. Comparable Cr-speciation results were obtained by performing equivalent higher spatial resolution SR μ-XRF/single-point μ-XANES analysis using a more conventional SDD from smaller regions of interest of each sample. Thus, large-area XRF mode FS-XANES imaging (Maia detector) is here proposed as a valuable and complementary data collection strategy in relation to “zoomed-in” high-resolution μ-XRF mapping and single-point μ-XANES analysis (SDD).},

In 1888 the artist moved into the only place he considered his own: his beloved "Yellow House" in Arles, France. His second-floor bedroom became a sanctuary, and it inspired him to record it in paint. Van Gogh so prized The Bedroom, which he deemed one of his best canvases, that he created two similar but distinct versions of it almost a year later, after being forced to leave his Yellow House following a nervous breakdown. In this reunion at the Art Institute of Chicago, the public has the extraordinary opportunity to see these three paintings hanging together as they did in Van Gogh's asylum studio. Presented only in Chicago, Van Gogh's Bedrooms is a momentous occasion that, along with this accompanying catalogue, sheds new light on these iconic compositions and the circumstances of their making. The exhibition is groundbreaking also because it is the first to consider the theme of home in the artist's work"–},

	abstract = {Visual sensitivity to small color difference is an important factor for precision color matching. Small color differences can be measured by the line element theory in terms of color distances between a color point and neighborhoods of points in a color space. This theory gives a smooth positive definite symmetric metric tensor which describes threshold of color differences by ellipsoids in three dimensions and ellipses in two dimensions. The metric tensor is also known as the Riemannian metric tensor. In regard to the color differences, there are many color difference formulas and color spaces to predict visual difference between two colors but, it is still challenging due to the nonexistence of a perfect uniform color space. In such case, the Riemannian metric tensor can be used as a tool to study the performance of various color spaces and color difference metrics for measuring the perceptual color differences. It also computes the shortest length or the distance between any two points in a color space. The shortest length is called a geodesic. According to Schrödinger's hypothesis geodesics starting from the neutral point of a surface of constant brightness correspond to the curves of constant hue. The chroma contours are closed curves at constant intervals from the origin measured as the distance along the constant hue geodesics. This hypothesis can be utilized to test the performance of color difference formulas to predict perceptual attributes (hue and chroma) and distribution of color stimulus in any color space. In this research work, a method to formulate line element models of color difference formulas the ΔE*ab, the ΔE*uv, the OSA-UCS ΔEE and infinitesimal approximation of CIEDE2000 (ΔE00) is presented. The Jacobian method is employed to transfer their Riemannian metric tensors in other color spaces. The coefficients of such metric tensors are used to compute ellipses in two dimensions. The performance of these four color difference formulas is evaluated by comparing computed ellipses with experimentally observed ellipses in different chromaticity diagrams. A method is also developed for comparing the similarity between a pair of ellipses. The technique works by calculating the ratio of the area of intersection and the area of union of a pair of ellipses. Similarly, at a fixed value of lightness L*, hue geodesics originating from the achromatic point and their corresponding chroma contours of the above four formulas in the CIELAB color space are computed by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations in association with their Riemannian metrics. They are compared with with the Munsell chromas and hue circles at the Munsell values 3, 5 and 7. The result shows that neither formulas are fully perfect for matching visual color difference data sets. However, Riemannized ΔE00 and the ΔEE formulas measure the visual color differences better than the ΔE*ab and the ΔE*uv formulas at local level. It is interesting to note that the latest color difference formulas like the OSA-UCS ΔEE and the Riemannized ΔE00 do not show better performance to predict hue geodesics and chroma contours than the conventional CIELAB and CIELUV color difference formulas and none of these formulas fit the Munsell data accurately},

The inks’ responses were recorded at 55\% and at 1\% relative humidity (RH) in air, and in a low oxygen environment ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextless10 ppm O2) at 55\% RH. Their light sensitivity in air was highly unpredictable, ranging from the detection limit of the technique to several times greater than the most fugitive ISO Blue Wool Fading Standard (BW1). With very few exceptions, the response of blue and black inks was markedly suppressed in anoxia, and the opposite was true of a significant proportion of red inks tested. The correlation between RH and light-sensitivity in air was weak, with highly variable responses in both directions. The results show that it is not possible to make useful display (light exposure) recommendations for ballpoint pen inks without prior fade-testing.},

Color-difference predictions are calculated using Gaussian process regression (GPR) considering the uncertainty of the visual data. The prediction accuracy of the CIE94 formula is significantly improved with the GPR approach for the Leeds and the Witt datasets. By upgrading CIE94 with GPR we achieve a significantly lower STRESS value of 26.58 compared with that for CIEDE2000 (27.49) on a combined dataset. The method could serve to improve the prediction performance of existing color-difference equations around particular color centers without changing the equations themselves.},

Learning to predict the past and original appearances of degraded drawings can help to envisage how the artist’s work may have looked at the time of creation. In this paper, we use reproductions as reference information for the past appearances of drawings and consider the reconstruction of drawings as a pixel-wise prediction problem. We present an approach to automatically predict the past appearances of drawings. This approach brings together methods from multi-resolution image analysis and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for addressing the task of pixel-wise prediction. Our experiments first investigate how scale affects prediction performance of the proposed multi-scale CNN framework and then demonstrate the reconstruction capability of the multi-scale CNN framework. The results demonstrate that the predictive reconstruction of degraded images is a feasible endeavor.},

While the shapes of the spectral reflectance curves of the brown inks on the drawings closely matched those of applications on paper of iron gall and chrome logwood ink, the spectral reflectance curve of a purple ink on the drawing Montmajour (1888) matched that of crystal violet and of the ink on a contemporary letter written by Van Gogh. HPLC-analysis of the ink extracted from a paper sample, taken from the drawings’ edge, indeed showed this to contain crystal violet, in admixture with its de-methylated derivatives. XRF-analysis of the brown metalcontaining inks confirmed the results obtained by FORS. These results indicate that, during his stay in Antwerp (1885), Van Gogh changed from iron gall to chrome logwood ink.},

Since the properties of the excited state can be affected easily by factors such as substituents and solvent properties it is suggested that the results obtained from using simple dye-solution systems to represent commercial dye-fabric systems must be examined critically. However, model systems are essential to provide more knowledge of the photochemistry of the compounds involved in this field. By employing flash photolysis, rigid solvents and electron spin resonance techniques, some indications have been obtained about the possible intermediates involved in the photochemical reactions of commercially dyed fibers. The effect of various factors (oxygen, temperature and humidity, atmospheric contaminants and concentration of dye) on the fading of dyes is discussed. The phototropic behavior of azo and thioindigoid dyes is described. The fading products resulting from the prolonged irradiation of dyes are discussed, as is the relation between the light-fastness of a dye and its chemical composition.},

This paper describes an experiment in which participants were asked how they would want to pass on a collection of seventeenth century hand-coloured maps to coming generations. Results show that while colour changes are hardly visible, both public and professionals do not perceive them as damage and prefer to spread fading. Once fading becomes clearly visible in all maps, the preference shifts to sacrificing one map. The tipping point lies around five just noticeable changes. This information can be used when selecting objects for exhibition. The outcome also implies it would be prudent to assess the degree of fading of much exhibited objects and consider whether and when to choose for a sacrifice strategy.},

	abstract = {This dissertation presents a study into the ultraviolet irradiation-initiated degradation phenomena occurring in titanium white containing oil paints, commonly referred to as photocatalytic degradation. The topic of this thesis can be summarized as: the (photocatalytic) properties of titanium white pigments in oil paints and their consequences for collections containing modern art. The thesis consists of three parts: 1) characterization of the use and properties of titanium white pigments, 2) understanding and monitoring the degradation of titanium white containing oil paints and 3) predicting degradation caused by titanium white pigments. Combining the results of these three parts leads to a risk management strategy for modern art collections presented as a conclusion of this thesis. \&lt;br/\&gt;Titanium white pigments were introduced in the 20th century as an alternative for lead white and zinc white. The pigments underwent a gradual development resulting in a large variety of pigments available throughout history. This variety ranges from very photocatalytic or ‘bad’ pigments, which severely speed up degradation, to photostable or ‘good’ pigments which can protect their environment from UV irradiation. Both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ pigments found their way into artist materials and thus into paintings. Hence the question ‘Titanium white, Friend or Foe?’. The pigment’s photocatalytic activity is highly dependent on the pigment’s crystal structure (rutile or anatase) and (inorganic) surface treatment. When a pigment is photocatalytic, radicals can form upon UV irradiation, which attack the oil binding medium and break it down to volatile components, leading to an effect called chalking: the pigment is unbound on the paint surface. \&lt;br/\&gt;Interestingly, while we know that ‘bad’ TiO2 pigments were used in modern oil paints, photocatalytic degradation problems have not been widely reported thus far. Several hypotheses for the lack of problems in collections are presented and investigated in this thesis. Additionally, characterization tools, predictive tools, and monitoring tools are developed, in order to provide solutions before it is too late. Simultaneously, analytical methods and research approaches, that are uncommon in the field of conservation science are explored to evaluate their applicability in answering cultural heritage research questions.},

Paper discolouration in a single journal type, the Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser published from the dates 1876–2004 was chosen as the focus of study, with a specific hypothesis to be tested; that the wartime journals were more discoloured by yellowing due to them being accessed more frequently. A series of measurements were carried out with a smartphone device using the camera to act as a colorimeter and converting the CIE L xy vector length into a yellowing parameter Y. A number of preliminary attempts were made to recreate conditions that corresponded to the measurements of Y using a conventional spectrophotometer, this was by standardising distance from object and through a number of lighting conditions. It was found that the most consistently comparable results (with an offset) could be obtained using an iPhone 6S with the light source from an additional iPhone with sample to aperture distance of 4 cm. Both studies showed that the large increase in Y occurred in journals printed around 1912 with a plateau of elevated Y value detected in journals until the 1950s after which the Y parameter decreased until 2004. This indicates the frequency access hypothesis to be false and this negative proof was able to be evidenced by the data collected by the iPhone. It would be suggested that great care needs to be taken if such an approach of stand-alone measurement were to be taken into citizen science; training and testing would need to be undertaken, because of the challenge of reproducibility and the risk of sampling irreplaceable objects.},

A technique is described that relies on a color-managed image, spectral reflectance factor measurements of the object, an optical model of colorant mixing, an optical database of artist materials, spreadsheet software, and image editing software. Spectral calculations are used to create adjustment curves where segmented portions of an object's image are translated in color. This approach has been used to produce color reconstructions of paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat. This colorimetric translation methodology is described and an example shown for the Chicago version of Vincent van Gogh's Bedroom. The methodology is compared with pixel-based processing.},

We analyze and characterize the discontinuity and give a visual presentation that allows better appreciation of its nature. For color pairs under 5 CIELAB delta E units apart, the maximum discontinuity magnitude is bounded by 0.274. For color pairs further apart in CIELAB, the magnitude of the discontinuity rises sharply. The results indicate that care should be exercised in using the formula in Taylor series approximations and that its use should be restricted to small color differences as recommended by the CIEDE2000 standard.},

Spectra obtained from pigment particles in these cross sections result in classification or identification of several pigments. The investigated paint samples are challenging test cases, as they contain several colored materials with a very fine distribution. VIS-imaging can identify and map the most common traditional blue pigments, i.e., smalt, azurite, ultramarine, and indigo in 17th century oil paintings. Smalt can be identified even after complete discoloration. VIS-imaging analysis assisted in the identification and mapping of modern synthetic red and yellow pigments in a 20th century painting.},

Damage to sensitive materials can be reduced by optimizing the spectrum of a light source to the reflectance factor of a museum artifact. Absorption minimization approaches can be utilized to quantify and optimize typically conflicting parameters, such as damage due to light absorption, color quality of artwork, and energy consumption. In this project, seven narrowband light emitting diodes (LEDs) are optimized using a multi-objective genetic algorithm to reduce light absorption and energy consumption, while maintaining the color appearance of five paints (blue, green, yellow, orange, red). Results indicate that optimized test spectra can reduce light absorption between 18\% and 48\%, without causing perceptible color or hue shifts in the paintings. Parallel to absorption, energy consumption is almost halved for all of the paints (between 42\% and 48\%). Optimizing the light source spectrum can aid in conservation of art collections in museums by reducing damage caused by optical radiation while preserving color fidelity.},

	abstract = {Numerous efforts have been made to investigate how light source color rendition affects color preference. Though the effect of light level on color appearance (known as the Hunt effect) was found in 1952, most studies investigating color preference under light sources only employed a single illuminance level and the illuminance levels were typically between 200 and 1000 lux. This article reports two psychophysical experiments that were designed to investigate how light source color rendition affected color preference across a wide range of illuminance levels, from 20 to 15,000 lux. The observers compared the color appearance of an artwork under nine nearly metameric light stimuli with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3000 K at different illuminance levels. These light stimuli were carefully designed to have different abilities to enhance the chroma of red and green colors, so that they had different gamut areas Rg (between 100 and 124 in Experiment 1 and between 99 and 117 in Experiment 2). It was found that the illuminance level significantly affected the observers’ judgments, with a light stimulus with a greater Rg being preferred at a lower light level. The light stimuli with an Rg beyond 100 were preferred at the light levels from 20 to 5000 lux, whereas those with an Rg around 100 were preferred at very high light levels (i.e., 10,000 and 15,000 lux). This suggested that the preference to the stimuli with an Rg beyond 100, as found in many past studies, was likely due to the relatively lower illuminance levels in comparison to the daylight illuminance levels. In addition, the calculations of the color attributes of the artwork under the preferred stimuli suggested that CIECAM02 may overestimate the effect of light level on color appearance, especially when the light level was very high, which merits further investigations.},

	abstract = {Vincent van Gogh's *Sunflowers* are seen by many as icons of Western European art. Two of these masterpieces â€” the first version painted in August 1888 (The National Gallery, London) and the painting made after it in January 1889 (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) â€” have been the subject of a detailed comparison by an interdisciplinary team of experts. The pictures were examined in unprecedented depth using a broad array of techniques, including state-of-the-art, non-invasive imaging analytical methods, to look closely at and under the paint surface. Not only the making, but also the subsequent history of the works was reconstructed, including later campaigns of restoration. The studyâ€™s conclusions are set out in this book, along with the fascinating genesis of the paintings and the sunflowerâ€™s special significance to Van Gogh. More than 30 authors, all specialists in the field of conservation, conservation science and art history, have contributed to the research and publication presenting the outcomes of this unique project.},

The aim of this experiment was to investigate age-related differences using an everyday-based visual search task in a large participant sample (n=261) aged 20–88years. Our results show that: (1) old–old adults have more difficulty with triple conjunction searches with one highly distinctive feature compared to young–old and younger adults; (2) age-related declines in conjunction searches emerge in middle age then progress throughout older age; (3) age-related declines are evident in feature searches on target absent trials, as older people seem to exhaustively and serially search the whole display to determine a target's absence. Together, these findings suggest that declines emerge in middle age then progress throughout older age in feature integration, guided search, perceptual grouping and/or spreading suppression processes. Discussed are implications for enhancing everyday functioning throughout adulthood.},

	abstract = {The ability of the human visual system to detect stimuli at low illumination levels provides awareness of potential risks. The influence of age and spectral power distribution on mesopic spectral sensitivity is analyzed. Two typical light sources are used, a high-pressure sodium lamp (HPS), with a higher content of long wavelengths, and a metal halide lamp (MH), with a higher content of short wavelengths. Two experiments were performed, using a two-channel Maxwellian-view optical system to measure contrast threshold under different experimental conditions. In Experiment 1, three age groups (young, middle-aged and old, n = 2 each), two retinal locations (on-axis and off-axis vision), four background luminances (0.01, 0.07, 0.45, and 3.2 cd/m2), and two photometry systems (photopic and the MES2 systems) were considered. In Experiment 2, contrast threshold measurement was performed with two age groups (young and old, n = 11 each), one retinal location (off-axis vision), one background luminance (0.01 cd/m2), and two photometry systems (photopic and the MES2 systems). In on-axis vision, neither age nor spectral power distribution have an effect on the contrast threshold. In off-axis vision, however, a significant interaction between age and spectral power distribution is obtained, albeit only at 0.01 cd/m2 with an MH lamp. Only at this lowest background luminance was the greater content of short wavelengths of this lamp responsible for higher rod stimulation in off-axis vision, with the subsequent improvement in detection performance in young subjects. However, the effect of diffused light inside the aged eye counteracted the benefits of increased rod sensitivity for the MH lamp.},

Unfortunately, current metrics only work well for narrow intensity ranges, and do not correlate well with experimental data outside these ranges. To address these issues, we propose a visual metric for predicting visibility (discrimination) and quality (mean-opinion-score). The metric is based on a new visual model for all luminance conditions, which has been derived from new contrast sensitivity measurements. The model is calibrated and validated against several contrast discrimination data sets, and image quality databases (LIVE and TID2008). The visibility metric is shown to provide much improved predictions as compared to the original HDR-VDP and VDP metrics, especially for low luminance conditions. The image quality predictions are comparable to or better than for the MS-SSIM, which is considered one of the most successful quality metrics. The code of the proposed metric is available on-line.},

	abstract = {Visual performance is defined in terms of the speed and accuracy of processing visual information. To evaluate illuminated tasks in terms of visual performance, it is necessary to have a valid computational model that relates measurable, salient aspects of the visual environment (e.g. target contrast) to measurable human responses (e.g. visual response time). A model of visual performance should be independent of the influence of non-visual factors as they influence speed and accuracy. It is also important to have practical application tools that can measure the salient aspects of the visual environment and compute (predict) visual performance for real tasks. This paper describes the basis for a visual performance model and how it can be applied using a computer imaging device. La performance visuelle est définie en termes de vitesse et de précision du traitement d'une information visuelle. Pour évaluer des tâches éclairées en termes de performance visuelle, il est nécessaire de disposer d'un modèle informatique valide qui fasse le lien entre des aspects mesurables importants de l'environnement visuel (par ex., le contraste de cible) et des réactions humaines mesurables (par ex., le temps de réaction visuelle). Un modèle de performance visuelle devrait être indépendant de l'influence de facteurs non visuels, lesquels influent sur la vitesse et la précision. Il est également important de pouvoir utiliser des outils d'application pratique qui peuvent mesurer les aspects mesurables importants de l'environnement visuel et calculer (prédire) la performance visuelle pour des tâches réelles.

A first matrix formulation of the Kubelka-Munk differential equations leads to a matrix framework based on transfer matrices, which can be extended to stacks of diffusing layers, stacks of nonscattering films, and stacks of scattering and non-scatterings films as a generalization of the WilliamsClapper model for prediction of the reflectance of paper photographs, each of these configurations being illustrated through various examples. This paper also exposes the limits of the two flux approach and shows that the matrix formalism extends in a straightforward manner to multiflux models, where the size of the matrices is increased.},

The more recent digital printing systems enable depositing thick coatings or successive ink layers. The color rendering of the surface depends on the optical properties of the coated materials (optical index, spectral scattering and absorption coefficients) and their thickness. In order to predict its spectral reflectance as a function of these parameters, the so-called two-flux approach is to be tested in first since the model is simple and relies on analytical equations. It has a good chance to provide accurate predictions for coatings made of solid layers of strongly scattering or nonscattering media, or even complex stratified coatings obtained by stacking nonsymmetrical components such as printed films. The generalized Kubelka-Munk model summarized in this paper enables treating all these configurations with a unified mathematical formalism. But it has limitations and may provide poor color predictions for certain types of layered materials. We therefore propose a simple method based on parameters of the model to check the precision of the two-flux model for a given type of coating.},

	abstract = {Organic dyes extracted from plants, insects, and shellfish have been used for millennia in dyeing textiles and manufacturing colorants for painting. The economic push for dyes with high tinting strength, directly related to high extinction coefficients in the visible range, historically led to the selection of substances that could be used at low concentrations. But a desirable property for the colorist is a major problem for the analytical chemist; the identification of dyes in cultural heritage objects is extremely difficult. Techniques routinely used in the identification of inorganic pigments are generally not applicable to dyes: X-ray fluorescence because of the lack of an elemental signature, Raman spectroscopy because of the generally intense luminescence of dyes, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy because of the interference of binders and extenders. Traditionally, the identification of dyes has required relatively large samples (0.5−5 mm in diameter) for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography. In this Account, we describe our efforts to develop practical approaches in identifying dyes in works of art from samples as small as 25 μm in diameter with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). In SERS, the Raman scattering signal is greatly enhanced when organic molecules with large delocalized electron systems are adsorbed on atomically rough metallic substrates; fluorescence is concomitantly quenched. Recent nanotechnological advances in preparing and manipulating metallic particles have afforded staggering enhancement factors of up to 1014. SERS is thus an ideal technique for the analysis of dyes. Indeed, rhodamine 6G and crystal violet, two organic compounds used to demonstrate the sensitivity of SERS at the single-molecule level, were first synthesized as textile dyes in the second half of the 19th century. In this Account, we examine the practical application of SERS to cultural heritage studies, including the selection of appropriate substrates, the development of analytical protocols, and the building of SERS spectral databases. We also consider theoretical studies on dyes of artistic interest. Using SERS, we have successfully documented the earliest use of a madder lake pigment and the earliest occurrence of lac dye in European art. We have also found several examples of kermes and cochineal glazes, as well as madder, cochineal, methyl violet, and eosin lakes, from eras ranging from ancient Egypt to the 19th century. The ability to rapidly analyze very small samples with SERS makes it a particularly valuable tool in a museum context.},

Even though the accuracy by which the spectra are obtained can be very high, the high price of these methods could pose an obstacle. On the other hand, there has been an interest in estimation of the spectral reflectance from colorimetric information that is more easily attainable; the accuracy in this case might not be as high but these methods are the most cost efficient. It is aimed, in this paper, to amalgamate the low price and high accuracy of the preceding approaches through relating spectral estimation to spectral sensitivity variability. The work is split into two major parts. The first part of the paper describes spectral sensitivity variability of humans and cameras in a theoretical manner and how it can be used in spectral recovery. In the second part, an attempt is made to extend the theory to real situations. At the end, it is shown how increasing the number of disparate colorimetric data of a specific object using the proposed methods aids in estimating spectral reflectance more accurately in a manner comparable to multi-spectral cameras.},

After analyzing the results, it is realized that although spectrally the results are satisfactory, there is still a significant colorimetric error left, that should be addressed. Therefore, in the second part of the article, different linear and nonlinear matrix transforms are used to change the RGB camera response to CIEXYZ tristimulus values under a specific condition.

	abstract = {Accurate measurements of reflectance and color require spectrophotometers with prices often exceeding \$3000. Recently, new “color instruments” became available with much lower prices, thanks to the availability of inexpensive colorimetric sensors. We investigated the Node+ChromaPro and the Color Muse, launched in 2015 and 2016 by Variable Inc. Both instruments are colorimeters, combining a colorimetric sensor with LED lighting. We investigated color accuracy compared to a high-end spectrophotometer from BYK Gardner. With different sets of samples we find for the Node an average value of dECMC (1:1) = 1.50, and a maximum of 7.86, when comparing with the 45° geometry of the spectrophotometer. Utilizing measurement data on the Spectral Power Distributions of the LEDs, we developed three methods to improve color accuracy as compared to the spectrophotometer data. We used these methods on different sets of samples with various degrees of gloss, both for training the models underlying the methods and for independent tests of model accuracy. Average color accuracy of the Node+ChromaPro improves from dECMC (1:1) = 1.82 to 1.16 with respect to spectrophotometer data. The percentage of samples with dECMC (1:1) {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextbackslashtextless 1.0 increases from 30.9\% (uncorrected) to 64\%. With the improved color accuracy, these sensors become useful for many more applications.},

ΔE*94 color differences of up to 5.2 could result. Because the errors are linearly related to CIELAB differences for each tile, a technique was derived that enabled ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb* coordinates between a calibrated tile and its measured value to be transformed into estimates of reference white, reference black, and wavelength error. The cyan tile was identified as the most effective tile for this technique. “Universal” equations are included for 45/Normal and Normal/Total geometries traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Normal/45, Normal/Total, and Normal/Diffuse geometries traceable to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).

Uncertainties are also required for establishing the traceability of a measurement to a national metrology institute.

Two important concepts are stressed—the measurement equation describing the relation between signals and the spectral reflectance factor and correlations both between signals at the same wavelength and between reflectance factors at different wavelengths.

There are different colorimetric applications in cultural heritage (eg, from light design to digitisation and modelling), and the variety of cultural material is extremely wide, from statues and frescoes, to old book and films. In this heterogeneous context, the development of instruments, measurements and tools faithful to the original objects are fundamental to correctly reproducing and representing materials, contrast and colours of the works under analysis.

The corresponding changes in colour data for the specular excluded geometry were calculated by NPL. Following a request from the Colour Measurement Committee of the Society of Dyers and Colourists, the corresponding changes in colour data for the specular included geometry were calculated by the Scottish College of Textiles on the assumption that the changes in spectral reflectance are the same for both geometries.

In this article, we develop reproducibility results from a medium-term study of 10 commercial spectrocolorimeters. The comparisons are presented so as to contrast between the traditional color difference based specifications found in the historical literature and in manufacturer's literature and the more complex multidimensional methods specified in E2214. Instrument to instrument contrasts are reported as well as tests of agreement across a set of instruments as a whole. The results confirm common understandings. Hemispherical diffuse instruments exhibit a higher level of inter-instrument agreement than do bidirectional (45:0) instruments. The results also provide support for a surprising conclusion about the statistical significance of the minor differences in both inter-instrument agreement and inter-model agreement for a single manufacturer.

At the 1992 AIC Interim Meeting at Princeton, NJ, one of the present authors presented a paper identifying all of the measurement parameters that limit the use of material standards as tools for evaluating the performance of spectrophotometers. At that time, the role of ambient and instrument generated temperature was cited as one of the largest contributors to errors in the measurements of standard materials. At the ISCC meeting, John Verrill of the NPL reported on work underway at NPL and CERAM to model the ambient temperature effects out of measurements of the spectral reflectance factor values of the Ceramic Colour Standards — Series II. This paper reports on the results of a three year study of the repeatability of a commercial reflectance spectrophotometer, showing that readings of ambient temperature can be used to correct apparent reflectance factor readings of the Ceramic Colour Standards so that very small, systematic errors in photometric and wavelength scales can be accurately monitored and charted. The results of the study also illustrate the long term stability of a commercial reflectance spectrophotometer and highlight its usefulness as a transfer instrument for secondary calibration measurements.},

Definitions of uncertainty components are offered, and methods of assessment and calculation of those components are revealed; this allows a user to prepare an uncertainty budget for their system. We address the practical applications of industrial measurement system uncertainty and example data sets are presented from measurements obtained from different industries. The reduction of uncertainty in color measurements can be addressed by training, the proper use of statistics, and reducing the systematic errors in spectrometers. Reducing systematic errors enables users to correlate global color values so that they will be nearly identical and can therefore be compared directly. This includes instruments manufactured by different manufacturers, and instruments manufactured by the same manufacturer. The methodology can be deployed on six different spectrometer modalities, including bi-directional geometries, that is, 45°/0°; hemispherical, either d/0° or d/8° geometries; or multi-angle geometries. Multi-angle geometries are used to characterize and assess gonioapparent colorants.},

The components of uncertainty analysed are 100\% level (diffuse reflectance), photometric non-linearity, dark level and wavelength error. Bandwidth error is not significant for NPL surface colour standards because a small bandwidth is always used. The gloss trap error and specular beam error are determined and corrected so that only the uncertainties after correction need be considered. These can be treated as components of dark level uncertainty. The uncertainties are determined for the following colour data: x, y, Y, u′, v′, L*, a* and b* for the CIE 10° Standard Observer and the CIE Standard Illuminant D65 for three geometries: specular included, specular excluded and 0°/45°.

The project's goal was to improve harmonisation of international colorimetric scales. One objective of the exercise was to devise a means of expressing total uncertainty in color measurement. When measuring color (or indeed any physical quantity), as assessment of the uncertainty of the result is as important as the value itself. This fact, long recognized in physics, is increasingly important to any quality assured organization that relies on measurements. The approach described first determines values of the sources of spectrophotometric uncertainty, and uses a simple model to combine these into total colorimetric uncertainties. The model has been used to determine uncertainties for the follow color data: x,y, T, u', v', L*, a* and b* for the CIE 10\&deg; Standard Observer and the CIE Standard Illiminant D$_{\textrm{65}}$\$\$\$ for three geometries: sepcular included, specular excluded and 0\&deg;/45\&deg;.

This article reports the results of the first phase of the program, an assessment of three commercial color-measuring instruments (Diano Match-Scan, Hunter D-54P-5, Macbeth MS-2000) for objective textile acceptability judgment. It is concluded that the three instruments are essentially equivalent in the precision and accuracy of the measurement of color and color difference using a wide variety of samples, at least over periods of up to seven weeks. All measures of repeatability lead to the conclusion that the uncertainties involved are well below the just-perceptible color difference. Levels of absolute accuracy achieved depend greatly on the details of operation, data treatment, and calibration, but are considered satisfactory for each of the instruments tested. With respect to certain other parameters, the performance of the instruments is less satisfactory. Rejection of the specular component differs significantly among the three, as does the selection of weights for tristimuus calculations. One instrument, as tested, exhibited significant sensitivity to weave orientation in textile samples. Finally, we find that the distributions of tristimulus values obtained with each of the instruments show large deviations from normality, severely limiting the significance of conventional statistical treatment of such data.},

	abstract = {At the primary care setting, where there are often no or minimal laboratories, examinations often consist of self-testing and rapid diagnostics. Because of this, medical devices must be simple, robust, and easy to operate. To address these concerns, an alternate fluorescence microscope design uses ultraviolet (UV) excitation, since fluorescent dyes that are excitable in the visible region are also excitable by UV. This may allow for the removal of typical excitation, emission, and dichroic filters as optical components absorb UV wavelengths and UV is not detected by silicon based detectors. Additionally, UV has a very low penetration into samples, which may allow for controlling the depth of excitation, and thus the imaging volume. Based on these ideas, we developed a simple fluorescence microscope built completely from off-the-shelf components that uses UV to image fluorescently stained samples. The simple opto-mechanical design of the system may allow it to be more compact and easy to use, as well as decrease the overall cost of the diagnostic device. For biological validation, we imaged whole blood stained with acridine orange and performed a two-part white blood cell differential count.},

The Army wished to have a numerical method of setting color tolerances to be used with instrumental measurement. Preliminary work with the standards and limit samples indicated that acceptability ellipsoids oriented in the hue, chroma, and lightness directions in CIELAB color space should be set up. To establish the tolerances, we selected pairs of samples from a large number of previous submissions by industry. These pairs represented four graduated lightness steps, four graduated chroma steps, and four graduated hue steps. Six observers looked at each pair ten times, randomly interspersed with other pairs, and issued a pass-or-fail judgment each time. From these data we established lightness, chroma, and hue tolerance limits. For an olive green and a tan shade, these tolerances were roughly in the ratio 3:2:1; for a dark blue, the ratios were roughly 2:2:1. We wrote simple equations that can be used in order to determine quickly whether a sample passes or fails.},

The pipeline and recommendations from this research will improve project management by increasing clarity of published outcomes, the reusability of data, and encouraging a more open discussion of process and application within the MSI community. The importance of thorough documentation is emphasised, which will encourage sharing of best practice and results, improving community deployment of the technique.

On a single instrument (Cary 14 spectrophotometer), three geometries were used: normal/diffuse (N/D), diffuse/normal (D/N) and normal/45° (N/45). For comparison, measurements were also made on a GE spectrophotometer (GERS) using near-normal/diffuse geometry.

For these samples, the Cary 14 N/D and GERS results are in good agreement, and the results with N/D and D/N geometries are essentially equivalent, but there is strong evidence of the serious problem of incomplete exclusion of the specular component with all of the integrating sphere geometries when operated in the specular-excluded mode, even with samples normally considered to be highly glossy or highly matte.},

This process is inherently dependent on the intensity distribution of the laser light used for both activation from the dark state and excitation of the bright state. Typically, laser light is coupled directly or via a single-mode fiber into the microscope, which leads to a Gaussian intensity profile in total internal reflection (TIR) or epi illumination. As a result, switching dynamics and brightness of the fluorescent molecules vary strongly across the field of view, impacting their localization precision and impeding quantitative analysis. Here we present a simple illumination scheme based on the use of a multimode fiber and a laser specklereducer, which results in a flat, homogeneous and speckle-free illumination across the entire field of view. In addition, we combined homogeneous multimode excitation of the sample with single-mode based TIR activation to simultaneously obtain the advantages of both approaches: uniform brightness of single fluorophores and TIR-like optical sectioning.},

	abstract = {Many organic compounds undergo changes under the influence of light. This might be beneficial in, for example, water purification, but undesirable when cultural-heritage objects fade or when food ingredients (e.g., vitamins) degrade. It is often challenging to establish a strong link between photodegradation products and their parent molecules due to the complexity of the sample. To allow effective study of light-induced degradation (LID), a low-volume exposure cell was created in which solutes are efficiently illuminated (especially at low concentrations) while simultaneously analysed by absorbance spectroscopy. The new LID cell encompasses a gas-permeable liquid-core waveguide (LCW) connected to a spectrograph allowing collection of spectral data in real-time. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the overall performance of the LID cell by assessing its transmission characteristics, the absolute photon flux achieved in the LCW, and its capacity to study solute degradation in presence of oxygen. The potential of the LID set-up for light-exposure studies was successfully demonstrated by monitoring the degradation of the dyes eosin Y and crystal violet.},

However, it has been found that computational failures can occur in certain cases such as during the image processing of cross-media color reproduction applications. Some proposals have been developed to repair the CIECAM02 model. However, all the proposals developed have the same structure as the original CIECAM02 model and solve the problems concerned at the expense of losing accuracy of predicted visual data compared with the original model. In this article, the structure of the CIECAM02 model is changed and the color and luminance adaptations to the illuminant are completed in the same space rather than in two different spaces, as in the original CIECAM02 model. It has been found that the new model (named CAM16) not only overcomes the previous problems, but also the performance in predicting the visual results is as good as if not better than that of the original CIECAM02 model. Furthermore the new CAM16 model is simpler than the original CIECAM02 model. In addition, if considering only chromatic adaptation, a new transformation, CAT16, is proposed to replace the previous CAT02 transformation. Finally, the new CAM16-UCS uniform color space is proposed to replace the previous CAM02-UCS space. A new complete solution for color-appearance prediction and color-difference evaluation can now be offered.},

Colorimetric data measured at specific temperature were compared with data measured at about 20 °C. For each coloured ceramic tile, reflectance curves and colorimetric differences resulting from temperature differences were examined to demonstrate the exact dependency of colorimetric properties across the temperature range studied. Experimental data showed that peaks and slopes on a reflectance curve are the major impact resulting from temperature variation. Colours with lower lightness and lower chroma showed smaller colorimetric changes with change in temperature, while colour with higher lightness and chroma exhibited a distinct thermochromism and linearity changes across the temperature range. A conspicuous correlation potential between surface temperature and CIE colorimetric coordinates was observed.},

This is valid not only in physical research but also in industrial production, where the importance of accurate measurements is mainly due to increased quality requirements set by the customers of various goods. The development of technology enables more and more accurate measuring systems. While the accuracy has improved one has noticed, that many unexpected factors affect the color of an object. One of these factors is the temperature of the sample. It is known that for example the reflectance of the ceramic reference tiles used for calibration of colorimeters and spectrophotometers is temperature dependent. This phenomenon is called thermochromism, which is a reversible change of color of the sample as a function of temperature. It may be noticed already at room temperature if the temperature varies few centigrades. Red and orange samples are especially sensitive to temperature variation and may cause difficulties in precise color measurements. We show, how the phenomenon is based on physical processes and not only reflects the instability of red color pigments. We derive simple formulas, which are shown to explain the experimental data. We also discuss the meaning of thermochromism for color measurements, measure the magnitude of it and propose the experimental conditions to avoid this effect.},

	abstract = {A seventeenth-century canvas painting is usually comprised of varnish and (translucent) paint layers on a substrate. A viewer’s perception of a work of art can be affected by changes in and damages to these layers. Crack formation in the multi-layered stratigraphy of the painting is visible in the surface topology. Furthermore, the impact of mechanical abrasion, (photo)chemical processes and treatments can affect the topography of the surface and thereby its appearance. New technological advancements in non-invasive imaging allow for the documentation and visualisation of a painting’s 3D shape across larger segments or even the complete surface. In this manuscript we compare three 3D scanning techniques, which have been used to capture the surface topology of Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer (c. 1665): a painting in the collection of the Mauritshuis, the Hague. These three techniques are: multi-scale optical coherence tomography, 3D scanning based on fringe-encoded stereo imaging (at two resolutions), and 3D digital microscopy. Additionally, scans were made of a reference target and compared to 3D data obtained with white-light confocal profilometry. The 3D data sets were aligned using a scale-invariant template matching algorithm, and compared on their ability to visualise topographical details of interest. Also the merits and limitations for the individual imaging techniques are discussed in-depth. We find that the 3D digital microscopy and the multi-scale optical coherence tomography offer the highest measurement accuracy and precision. However, the small field-of-view of these techniques, makes them relatively slow and thereby less viable solutions for capturing larger (areas of) paintings. For Girl with a Pearl Earring we find that the 3D data provides an unparalleled insight into the surface features of this painting, specifically related to ‘moating’ around impasto, the effects of paint consolidation in earlier restoration campaigns and aging, through visualisation of the crack pattern. Furthermore, the data sets provide a starting point for future documentation and monitoring of the surface topology changes over time. These scans were carried out as part of the research project ‘The Girl in the Spotlight’.},

Conventional methods consisted of an aperture technique using aluminium foil and four different materials namely stainless steel, silicon, muscovite, and Teflon used as sharp edges. The imaging methods consisted of digital photography of illumination spot, direct beam measurement using a CMOS camera, and direct beam measurement using a laser beam profiler. The results show that both conventional and imaging methods provide beam width measurements, which are in satisfactory agreement within experimental error.

This informs future use and representation. Value (which may be assigned for different reasons) makes heritage. All heritage is valued for varied reasons. Some argue that heritage has inherent value; this is not covered in this paper. Some values are preferred over others in decisions on what to use or conserve. The process below describes a number of different recurring phases in this relationship, which differs with different kinds of heritage: 1. Various agents change heritage; 2. Change affects valued elements of heritage; 3. Valued elements affect how change is perceived; 4. What is perceived as damage affects decisions about conservation interventions; 5. Conservation affects which valued elements are most likely to be preserved; 6. Preserved elements influence how heritage is represented; 7. New forms of representation will affect future conservation decisions. Historically, how heritage has been represented has affected how an object is preserved. This affects later representation and use, making the relationship symbiotic.},

Discussing the climate in an unheated museum in the late nineteenth century, to the extremely dry environment in a heated building in the early twentieth century. Experience with collection preservation during the Second World War indicated the positive effect of a stable relative humidity. Since the mid twentieth century the set point for the relative humidity and temperature closely followed the technical development of climate systems. Resulting in an uncontrolled increase in energy demand. The effect of these adaptations on the building and climate control systems was enormous. Confidence in the technology grew, all though in practice numerous examples exist of malfunctioning of these systems. The overall risks to the moveable collections have increased to an almost unacceptable level.With this publication collection managers and stakeholders are assisted; by providing information that will allow responsible decisions about the museum’s indoor climate to be made. The focus is not only on the outcome, but also on the equally important process, which leads to that outcome. Nine consecutive steps are proposed to structure the decision making: valuation, assessment of the collection needs, the building needs, human comfort requirements, preparing for a balanced decision, understanding the building physics, climate control strategies and finally a cost-benefit analysis to make a choice.},

Results have highlighted the effectiveness of policies and practices already in place. However, the assessment also provided evidence of current weaknesses, and helped prioritise necessary work to improve further the management of the collection. This paper details what actions have been taken at The National Archives to improve issues such as environmental conditions within storage areas, mitigating risk of physical damage to documents from handling, policies on the use of archival microfilm masters, and to reduce damage and loss of original records by substitution copying. Résumé «Gestion d’une collection en utilisant une évaluation des risques pour la conservation» Entre 2005 et 2007, les Archives Nationales de Grande Bretagne ont mené un vaste programme d’évaluation des risques liés à la conservation de sa collection de documents originaux du gouvernement. Les résultats ont mis en lumière l’efficacité des politiques et des pratiques déjà en place. Cependant, l’évaluation a aussi mis en évidence des faiblesses actuelles et a aidé à orienter les priorités de travail nécessaires pour améliorer davantage la gestion des collections. Cet article détaille les actions qui ont été menées aux Archives Nationales afin d’améliorer certains aspects comme les conditions environnementales à l’intérieur des zones de stockage, la minimisation des risques de dommages physiques sur les documents dus aux manipulations, les politiques sur l’utilisation des masters de microfilms pour l’archivage, et les actions menées pour réduire les dommages et les pertes d’enregistrements originaux en substituant des copies.

The results have been averaged and a mean set of trichromatic coefficients for the spectral colours derived. These results are compared with previous determinations made by König and Abney. The variations in the coefficients that have been found amongst the ten observers must, as a consequence of a new method of basing the trichromatic units, be attributed to variations in the process of reception, but their magnitude appears to be of a small order. On the other hand, there are big differences in the amount of the macular pigment in different eyes and probably some variation in its dominant hue. These variations have been investigated by matches on a standard white, results for 36 observers being given in the paper and a mean value determined. This value, combined with the mean spectral coefficients, has been used to compute an average locus for the spectral colours in the colour triangle, with white at the centre. Other points discussed in the paper include the technique of colour matching, the range of intensity over which matches remained valid, and variations of luminosity.},

	abstract = {All successful imaging systems employ some form of color management for previewing, controlling and adjusting color throughout the image-production process. Today's increasingly complex systems pose challenging problems: they must support numerous devices and media having disparate color properties, and they also must provide for the interchange of images among dissimilar systems. In this book, the authors address and solve these problems using innovative methods of representing color in the digital domain. The second edition of this popular book explains the capabilities and limitations of existing color management systems and provides comprehensive practical solutions for communicating color within and among imaging systems, from the simplest to the most complex. Beginning with the fundamentals of color and human color perception, the book progresses to in-depth analyses of the nature of color images, digital color encoding, color management systems and digital color interchange. Fully revised and updated, this second edition of Digital Color Management features new and expanded coverage including: electronic displays and electronic imaging systems; scene-based and appearance-based color encoding methods; color management for digital cinema; a Unified Paradigm–a comprehensive, integrated color-managed environment for the color-imaging industry; four new chapters, two new appendices, and more than 80 new figures. This book is an essential resource for engineers, programmers and imaging professionals designing and engineering color-imaging systems and for others simply looking to increase their understanding of the field. Scientists, researchers, advanced undergraduates and graduate students involved in imaging technology also will find this book of significant interest and usefulness.

	doi = {10.1167/5.11.3},
	abstract = {We propose a new luminosity function, V*(lambda), that improves upon the original CIE 1924 V(lambda) function and its modification by D. B. Judd (1951) and J. J. Vos (1978), while being consistent with a linear combination of the A. Stockman \& L. T. Sharpe (2000) long-wavelength-sensitive (L) and middle-wavelength-sensitive (M) cone fundamentals. It is based on experimentally determined 25 Hz, 2 degrees diameter, heterochromatic (minimum) flicker photometric data obtained from 40 observers (35 males, 5 females) of known genotype, 22 with the serine variant L(ser180), 16 with the alanine L(ala180) variant, and 2 with both variants of the L-cone photopigment. The matches, from 425 to 675 nm in 5-nm steps, were made on a 3 log troland xenon white (correlated color temperature of 5586 K but tritanopically metameric with CIE D65 standard daylight for the Stockman and Sharpe L- and M-cone fundamentals in quantal units) adapting field of 16 degrees angular subtense, relative to a 560-nm standard. Both the reference standard and test lights were kept near flicker threshold so that, in the region of the targets, the total retinal illuminance averaged 3.19 log trolands. The advantages of the new function are as follows: it forms a consistent set with the new proposed CIE cone fundamentals (which are the Stockman \& Sharpe 2000 cone fundamentals); it is based solely on flicker photometry, which is the standard method for defining luminance; it corresponds to a central 2 degrees viewing field, for which the basic laws of brightness matching are valid for flicker photometry; its composition of the serine/alanine L-cone pigment polymorphism (58:42) closely matches the reported incidence in the normal population (56:44; Stockman \& Sharpe, 1999); and it specifies luminance for a reproducible, standard daylight condition. V*(lambda) is defined as 1.55L(lambda) + M(lambda), where L(lambda) and M(lambda) are the Stockman \& Sharpe L- \& M-cone (quantal) fundamentals. It is extrapolated to wavelengths shorter than 425 nm and longer than 675 nm using the Stockman \& Sharpe cone fundamentals.},

The kurtosis index is shown to correlate better with subjective estimates of the distinctness of the reflected images than the conventional measure, 60° specular gloss. The kurtosis index is applied to one problem in the selection of optimum glossmeter geometry.},

An Elsec 764 hand-held light meter was used to record the light intensity falling on collection material held within and without V-shaped book mounts and with sequential lights turned on, as occurs in collections’ use. The authors developed a simple algebraic formula to calculate cumulative doses of light and incident ultraviolet radiation to determine how many hours collection material could be accessed and illuminated before damage could be expected. The authors calculated the maximum cumulative doses possible based on numbers of access hours and compared these to recommended doses for sensitive media as a monitoring strategy for the long-term preservation of light sensitive special collection materials. The results from this study suggest that the light levels evaluated are not in excess of recommended values and that the use of book mounts reduces the amount of light falling on collection material. Monitoring actions are recommended for institutions wishing to replicate the study.},

A “colorant” can refer to a dye, pigment, or ink, as well as chromatic lights used in various display technologies. Computer colorant formulation systems are an embodiment of the color modeling of materials such as textiles, plastics, and paint. Color management systems for imaging applications exploit color models of CRT displays, photographic materials, and printers. The literature on modeling material and imaging systems tends to be segregated. In the process of teaching color modeling, common methodologies and theories have emerged leading to a “generic” approach. All of these systems can be modeled using two basic stages. The first stage consists of defining a spectral description where colorants and their mixtures can be described using linear algebra. The second stage defines the relationship between “user controls” and the scalars associated with the linear description of each colorant where the user control may be digital counts, volumetric or gravimetric concentration. The commonalities between characterizing the colorimetry of computer-controlled CRT displays and computer colorant formulation are presented. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {For opaque coloration systems, Kubelka-Munk turbid media theory is used commonly to model optical mixing behavior. Most educational publications on the subject use opaque paint systems when describing the two-constant approach and textile systems when describing the single-constant simplification. Because of the differences in defining concentration for these systems and the corresponding degrees of freedom, the single-constant simplification for paint and textile systems are not identical. The second edition of “Principles of Color Technology” showed a numerical example for an opaque paint system modeled using the textile equations. The third edition used the same example but modified the degrees of freedom, a hybrid of the paint and textile approaches. Recent research by Berns and Mohammadi has evaluated the single-constant simplification for modeling artist paints; they have used both the hybrid and paint approaches. Thus, it was of interest to review these different approaches and determine whether these differences have practical importance and whether future printings and editions of Principles of Color Technology should be modified. The three approaches were tested for tints made from a mixture of cobalt blue and titanium white acrylic emulsion artist paints. The differences between the textile and hybrid approaches were inconsequential. The paint approach was superior and its use is recommended for opaque paint systems. The differences in the numerical example from Principles of Color Technology were very small. For future printings of the third edition, the example will remain unchanged. For future editions, including the numerical example remains an open question. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 32, 201–207, 2007},

Generally, both the diagnosis and correction of spectrophotometric errors require a number of calibrated standard reference materials and considerable effort and commitment on the part of the user. A technique using multiple linear regression has been developed, based on the measurement of several suitably chosen standard reference materials, to both diagnose and correct systematic spectrophotometric errors, including photometric zero errors photometric linear and nonlinear scale errors, wavelength linear and nonlinear scale errors, and bandwidth errors. The use of a single chromatic ceramic tile to correct systematic errors improved the colorimetric accuracy of a set of chromatic and neutral tiles by a factor of two for a typical industrial-oriented spectrophotometer. Greater improvement can be achieved by increasing the number of tiles and performing a separate regression at each measured wavelength., These techniques have been extremely useful in improving inter-instrument agreement for instruments with similar geometry.},

The tolerance determination procedures emphasized accurate estimation of population visual color-difference response and rigorous estimation of tolerance precision. Tolerance accuracy was confirmed by excellent agreement of these results and the majority of previous experiments on five color centers selected for CIE color-difference evaluations. The average uncertainty of the tolerance determinations was ± 11\% of the tolerance value at a 2 ó level (95\% confidence interval). The completed data set is suitable for estimating the parameters of color-difference metrics or testing the performance of such metrics. The color tolerances indicated the systematic lack of uniformity of the CIELAB space, in general agreement with previous experiments. A simple modification of the CIELAB color-difference metric was shown to account for much of the systematic lack of uniformity.},

When models are used to relate digital counts defining a stimulus and resulting spectral radiant exitance, displays are assumed to exhibit channel and spatial independence. A variety of tests and the results of evaluating four imaging systems are described. From these analyses, measurement accuracy is mainly limited by wavelength scale in the case of spectro-radiometers and filter fit in the case of colorimeters. Measurement precision is limited by the number of significant figures for fixed-range devices and signal-to-noise limitations for low-luminance stimuli. Display accuracy is limited by a lack of channel and spatial independence.

	abstract = {Relating instrumentally measured to visually perceived colour-differences is one of the challenges of advanced colorimetry. Lately, the use of color difference formulas is becoming more important in the computer vision field as it is a key tool in advancing towards perceptual image processing and understanding. In the last decades, the study of contours of equal color-differences around certain color centers has been of special interest. In particular, the contour of threshold level difference that determines the just noticeable differences (JND) has been deeply studied and, as a result, a set of 19 different ellipsoids of suprathreshold color-difference is available in the literature. In this paper we study whether this set of ellipsoids could be used to compute any color difference in any region of the color space. To do so, we develop a fuzzy multi-ellipsoid model using the ellipsoids information along with two different metrics. We see that the performance of the two metrics vary significantly for very small, small, medium and large color differences. Therefore, we also study how to adapt two metric parameters to optimize performance. The obtained results outperform the currently CIE-recommended color-difference formula CIEDE2000.},

	abstract = {The integration of color and form to produce a unified percept is a central problem in vision research. We know that the spatial arrangement of colored stimuli influences their detectability. In the gap effect, for example, a small gap between two colored fields enhances their discriminability [Opt. Acta24, 159 (1977)]. Chromatic thresholds are also reduced when test fields are spatially demarcated. To explore the mechanisms underlying these types of effect, the influence of spatial structure on chromatic sensitivity for gratings was measured. For sine-wave and square-wave gratings modulated in different directions in color space, contrast sensitivity was measured by using a two-alternative forced-choice procedure with a QUEST staircase. Thin lines, of the same orientation as that of the grating, were superimposed on it at half-cycle intervals. The phase of the superimposed lines was varied. For S-cone modulated gratings, dark lines placed at the midpoints between peaks and troughs (90°) increased sensitivity. As the phase of the lines moved toward the peaks (0°), their effect on sensitivity declined to zero. A similar but smaller effect was seen for isoluminant L- and M-cone modulated gratings. The superimposed lines always impaired contrast sensitivity for achromatic gratings, especially at a phase of 0°. Spatial structure superimposed on gratings can both facilitate and impair contrast sensitivity. In the presence of sharp boundaries, chromatic sensitivity is increased. This effect may depend more on the salience of boundaries, since isoluminant lines superimposed on S-cone modulated gratings and gray lines of similar cone contrast can facilitate detection if they are of sufficient contrast. Achromatic contrast sensitivity is reduced when the boundaries are present. The additional luminance information at the boundaries masks the grating. A simple model in which spatial integration is arrested at the positions of the superimposed lines fits only the isoluminant conditions. For both luminance and chromatic contrast the change in sensitivity depends on phase.},

The experimental results ranged from small (including threshold) to large color difference at the five CIE color centers, which were satisfactorily described by chromaticity ellipses as equal color-difference contours in the CIELAB space. The comparisons of visual and colorimetric scales in CIELAB unit and threshold unit indicated that the colorimetric magnitudes typically were linear with the visual ones, though with different proportions in individual directions or color centers. In addition, color difference was generally underestimated by the Euclidean distance in the CIELAB space, whereas colorimetric magnitude was perceptually underestimated for threshold unit, implying the present color system is not a really linear uniform space. Furthermore, visual data were used to test the CIELAB-based color-difference formulas.

Colour appearance models have been developed to predict colour appearance under different viewing conditions. They are also capable of evaluating colour differences because of their embedded uniform colour spaces. This article first tests the performance of the CIE 2002 colour appearance model, CIECAM02, in predicting three types of colour discrimination data sets: large- and small-magnitude colour differences under daylight illuminants and small-magnitude colour differences under illuminant A. The results showed that CIECAM02 gave reasonable performance compared with the best available formulae and uniform colour spaces. It was further extended to give accurate predictions to all types of colour discrimination data. The results were very encouraging in that the CIECAM02 extensions performed second best among all the colour models tested and only slightly poorer than the models that were developed to fit a particular data set. One extension derived to fit all types of data can predict well for colour differences having a large range of difference magnitudes. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Before 1997, a number of colour appearance models were developed and experimental psychophysical datasets were accumulated to aid the development of these models and help with their verification. In 1997, CIECAM97s was the first model formally recommended by CIE. In 2002, CIECAM02 was recommended, a refinement of CIECAM97s. These models were limited to related colours of approximately two degrees, viewed under photopic conditions. Since that time work has progressed to develop a comprehensive colour appearance model to include the prediction of correlates of colour appearance over the photopic to scotopic range, the variation of stimulus size, the appearance of unrelated colours – light sources – and a uniform colour space to allow the calculation of colour difference in appearance space.},

Observers were asked to make discriminations based upon a criterion of color difference or of the perception of a border between fields. The area of the fields was varied either by increasing the length of their common junction or by increasing their widths at constant junction length. For fields larger than 0.2–0.4 deg2, area controls sensitivity. For smaller fields, discrimination may be worse for narrow fields with long common junctions than for wide ones with small common junctions, especially for discriminations that depend upon S cones, in which the field components tend to become spatially integrated. Decreasing viewing time reduces the magnitude of this effect. S cone and L-M channel acuities were estimated at about 7 and 32 c/deg, respectively.},

We here describe measurements of the gap effect in the parafovea. The stimuli were 1 deg of visual angle in width and were centered on an imaginary circle of radius 5 deg. They were brief (100 ms), and thresholds were measured with a spatial two-alternative forced choice. Under these conditions we find a clear gap effect, which is of similar magnitude for both the cardinal chromatic axes. It may be a chromatic analog of the crowding effect observed for parafoveal perception of form.},

For a discrimination based solely on S cone activity, separating steadily-viewed fields by either a luminance or a purely chromatic gap caused similar enhancements of sensitivity. Neither type of gap had much effect when the fields were flashed.

	abstract = {To identify surface properties independently of the illumination the visual system must make assumptions about the statistics of scenes and their illumination. Are assumptions about the intensity of the illumination independent of assumptions about its chromaticity? To find out, we asked participants to judge whether test patches within three different sets of surrounding surfaces were white or grey. Two sets were matched in terms of their maximal luminance, their mean luminance and chromaticity, and the variability in their luminance and chromaticity, but differed in how luminance and chromaticity were associated: the highest luminance was either associated with colorful surfaces or with achromatic ones. We found that test patches had to have a higher luminance to appear white when the highest luminance in the surrounding was associated with colorful surfaces. This makes sense if one considers that being colorful implies that a surface only reflects part of the light that falls on it, meaning that the illumination must have a higher luminance (a perfectly white surface reflects all of the light falling on it). In the third set, the colorful surfaces had the same luminance as in the set in which they were associated with the highest luminance, but the achromatic surfaces had a lower luminance so that the overall mean luminance was lower. Despite the constraints on the illumination being identical, test patches did not have to have as high luminance to appear white for the third set. Considering the layout of the surfaces in the surrounding revealed that test patches did have to have the same high luminance if the high luminance colorful surfaces were adjacent to the target patch. Thus, the assumptions about the possible illumination are applied locally. A possible mechanism is relying on the contrast within each type of cone: for a surface to appear white it must stimulate each of the three kinds of cones substantially more than do any neighboring surfaces.},

	abstract = {The “Scientific Colour Organ” is a collection of 680 pigment powders, created by the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald in 1925 as a means to represent his colour system. Today, it remains a leading part of colour theory. Analysis of these materials was undertaken to understand how the colour system was realised and to gain indications for preservation of the collection to which it belongs. Dispersive Raman microspectroscopy was applied directly to the powders, as well as using alternative techniques to suppress fluorescence. Barium sulphate was detected in all of the samples with one exception. Portable X-ray fluorescence revealed that this compound was a constituent of lithopone pigment. Raman spectroscopy furthermore revealed synthetic ultramarine (C.I. PB 29) as well as six different synthetic organic pigments and dyes (C.I. PY3; C.I. PO5; C.I. PR81:1; C.I. PV2 and two different triarylmethane dyes). Thin-layer chromatography was applied to determine the exact combination of dyes causing the gradual change in colour of each powder compared to the adjacent samples. With the exception of triarylmethane, the synthetic organic dyes could be identified with Raman spectroscopy directly on the chromatographic plate. The efficiency of thin-layer chromatography combined with Raman spectroscopy for identification of organic pigments could thus be shown. X-ray fluorescence indicated the presence of tungsten–molybdenum lakes in some samples. Comparison of the analytical results to information published by Oswald in 1917 showed that he switched to more light-stable synthetic organic pigments used for his “Scientific Colour Organ”.},

	abstract = {Chemists are masters of colors, be it their synthesis or the analysis of natural dyes and pigments. Therefore, it is mandatory that chemistry students acquire some basic knowledge of color theories. The contemporaries of Wilhelm Ostwald (1853–1932), Nobel Laureate for Chemistry in 1909, repeatedly refused to accept and often even acidly opposed his new and unconventional ideas. This also happened in response to his color doctrine, which he regarded as his opus magnum. The accepted color theory of his times was based on the concept of the trichromatic color vision of Thomas Young (1773–1829) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894). Contrary to this theory, Ostwald emphasized the psychological issues of color perception. He introduced new terms and variables of colors, developed pragmatic ways to measure colors and assembled them in a ‘color solid’ (a three-dimensional frame of colors). Many physicists disagreed with his ideas, since they regarded Helmholtz’s theory as sufficient and Ostwald’s as superfluous. Then, when Ostwald derived color harmony from his color order, he also had many artists as enemies. Indeed, Ostwald’s color theory is not without flaws. However, he had mainly in mind the applications of colors in arts, design and industry. With that focus, another understanding results, as Ostwald’s color doctrine provides a theory of body colors that is relatively simple, descriptive, practical and fruitful for further development.},

	abstract = {A domain of color science based on color atlases has to be sharply distinguished from conventional colorimetry. If essentially colorimetric results are desired, a color atlas is at a severe disadvantage. Even a technically flawless atlas will yield results that depend on ideosyncrasies of the observer (e.g., if the observer is an anomalous trichromat, this shows up in the results) even if the light source is within strict tolerances. If the source is not well specified, the results will degrade even further. However, the use of a color atlas also has some very important advantages. These are, apart from the obvious practical assets such as cost savings, speed, and intuitive trustworthiness, as follows: first, if a sample looks like a fiducial sample (or a small environment of fiducial samples) for several illuminants, then its bidirectional reflection function (BDRF) must be similar to that of the fiducial samples; and second, the equality of materials can be established by any observer (anomalous or not) if the illuminant is varied. Thus the use of an atlas leads to a physical classification (i.e., one based on the BDRF’s) rather than a merely colorimetric classification. In order to serve well, the atlas must be composed of physically well-specified fiducial samples, and different atlases may be needed for different tasks. In this paper the rational construction of such atlases to optimize various desirable properties is discussed.},

Methods are described for eliminating surface reflection, which is always superimposed upon the diffuse reflection and which therefore distorts the spectrum. The effect of interactions with the adsorbent on the reflection spectra of adsorbed molecules is demonstrated by means of examples, and the special suitability of the method for investigating chemisorption and for following reactions at phase boundaries is pointed out. By analogy to the Beer-Lambert law, the Kubelka-Munk function can be used for quantitative photometric analysis. The reflectance curves of white standards are presented, and measurements relating to the conditions for “infinitely thick layers” are reported. The scattering coefficient of the Kubelka-Munk functions has been estimated for several samples of color-filters as a functions of grain-size and wavelength. The effect of moisture on diffuse reflectance spectra is discussed, and details of the measuring techniques are presented.},

Painted samples were produced for constant step width along the main axes of previously determined threshold (x,y,Y)-ellipsoids with lightness variation at constant (x,y)-chromaticity starting with threshold length and enlarging it five times for moderate magnitude of colour difference. Pairs were formed for linear extensions along axes and for diagonal combinations at equal step width between axes. The model under test assumes additive linear scale extension in constant proportions of the threshold (x,y,Y)-ellipsoid for increasing magnitude of perceived colour difference and correlates perceptual main colour characters with main ellipsoid axes. Both assumptions were falsified to some degree: in general, magnitude of colour difference varies differently, though close to linear, and slightly subadditive for the three axes and for the different colour centers; the short (x,y)-ellipse axis in some cases is not correlated with a perceptual hue vector component, and the main lightness direction sometimes is tilted in relation to the (x,y)-plane. Three colour-difference formulae do not provide better global predictions than the local (x,y,Y)-ellipsoid formulae. The results may be used for more detailed modeling of colour-difference formulae and for tolerance settings at different ranges of colour difference. © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

In fact, five perceptual dimensions are required for a complete specification of color appearance: brightness, lightness, colorfulness, saturation, and hue.

This is a report on the history, the colorimetric basis and specification, and the use of the several editions of the Manual. Included are representative colorimetric datafor the third edition. The Ostwald hue triangles and a color solid made with them portray and help explain the sensory world of color. Important sequences, the clears, lie on the outside surface of the solid. Color scales of equal blackness and whiteness are defined. Comparisons are made with the designs of the color charts in other atlases. An appendix concerning the third edition discusses a Descriptive Color Names Dictionary, availability of matching paints, a set of artists' colors, and production details of the colors.},

Applying combinatorics, which grew out of his philosophy of nature and which was viewed by Ostwald as a basis for creativity, Ostwald developed a theory of forms and colors. His work influenced marginally the activities of such movements in art like the German Werkbund, the Dutch De Stijl, and the Bauhaus.

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Because this type of measurement can be made without contacting the sample, it is a powerful technique for the remote determination of the composition of soils and regoliths on the surfaces of bodies of the solar system, as well as powders in the laboratory. Analysis of the specular reflection from the polished surface of a solid can give the complex index of refraction using the Kramers-Kronig method. The exact solution of Maxwell's equations for the scattering of light by realistic powders and soils is well beyond present computational ability. However, approximate models of diffuse reflectance based on the equation of radiative transfer are capable of quantitatively predicting the angular scattering behavior and measuring the spectral absorption coefficient of particulate media.},

	abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

The system uses high quality optics through the implementation of a stereo-microscope as its central element. This technology enables new developments such as incorporation of high quality imaging systems, and separation of fading and colour measurement processes. This paper describes this new micro-fading set-up and evaluates its performance against traditional devices based on the measurement of blue wool standards. The results show a correlation between the fading performance obtained on different devices while highlighting a significant variability inherent to the blue wool samples},

	abstract = {The remote sensing community puts major efforts into calibration and validation of sensors, measurements, and derived products to quantify and reduce uncertainties. Given recent advances in instrument design, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, algorithm development, product development, validation, and delivery, the lack of standardization of reflectance terminology and products becomes a considerable source of error. This article provides full access to the basic concept and definitions of reflectance quantities, as given by Nicodemus et al. [Nicodemus, F.E., Richmond, J.C., Hsia, J.J., Ginsberg, I.W., and Limperis, T. (1977). Geometrical Considerations and Nomenclature for Reflectance. In: National Bureau of Standards, US Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. URL: http://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div844/facilities/specphoto/pdf/geoConsid.pdf.] and Martonchik et al. [Martonchik, J.V., Bruegge, C.J., and Strahler, A. (2000). A review of reflectance nomenclature used in remote sensing. Remote Sensing Reviews, 19, 9–20.]. Reflectance terms such as BRDF, HDRF, BRF, BHR, DHR, black-sky albedo, white-sky albedo, and blue-sky albedo are defined, explained, and exemplified, while separating conceptual from measurable quantities. We use selected examples from the peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate that very often the current use of reflectance terminology does not fulfill physical standards and can lead to systematic errors. Secondly, the paper highlights the importance of a proper usage of definitions through quantitative comparison of different reflectance products with special emphasis on wavelength dependent effects. Reflectance quantities acquired under hemispherical illumination conditions (i.e., all outdoor measurements) depend not only on the scattering properties of the observed surface, but as well on atmospheric conditions, the object's surroundings, and the topography, with distinct expression of these effects in different wavelengths. We exemplify differences between the hemispherical and directional illumination quantities, based on observations (i.e., MISR), and on reflectance simulations of natural surfaces (i.e., vegetation canopy and snow cover). In order to improve the current situation of frequent ambiguous usage of reflectance terms and quantities, we suggest standardizing the terminology in reflectance product descriptions and that the community carefully utilizes the proposed reflectance terminology in scientific publications.},

As such, every spectroscopist should know its limits and potential pitfalls, arising from its application, by heart. It is the goal of this work to review these limits and pitfalls, as well as to provide solutions and explanations to guide the reader. This guidance will allow a deeper understanding of spectral features, which cannot be explained by the Beer-Lambert law, because they arise from electromagnetic effects/the wave nature of light. Those features include band shifts and intensity changes based exclusively upon optical conditions, i.?e. the method chosen to record the spectra, the substrate and the form of the sample. As such, the review will be an essential tool towards a full understanding of optical spectra and their quantitative interpretation based not only on oscillator positions, but also on their strengths and damping constants.},

	abstract = {Abstract Beer's empiric law states that absorbance is linearly proportional to the concentration. Based on electromagnetic theory, an approximately linear dependence can only be confirmed for comparably weak oscillators. For stronger oscillators the proportionality constant, the molar attenuation coefficient, is modulated by the inverse index of refraction, which is itself a function of concentration. For comparably weak oscillators, the index of refraction function depends, like absorbance, linearly on concentration. For stronger oscillators, this linearity is lost, except at wavenumbers considerably lower than the oscillator position. In these transparency regions, linearity between the change of the index of refraction and concentration is preserved to a high degree. This can be shown with help of the Kramers?Kronig relations which connect the integrated absorbance to the index of refraction change at lower wavenumbers than the corresponding band. This finding builds the foundation not only for refractive index sensing, but also for new interferometric approaches in IR spectroscopy, which allow measuring the complex index of refraction function.},

Usually, chemical interactions and instrumental imperfection are made responsible for experimental deviations from this linearity. In this contribution we show that even in the absence of such interactions and instrumental errors, absorbance should be only approximately proportional to concentration. This can be derived from the quadratic dependence of the complex refractive index, and, by that, of the molar attenuation coefficient, from the dielectric constant and its frequency dispersion. Following dispersion theory, it is the variation of the real and the imaginary part of the dielectric function that depends linearly on concentration in the absence of interactions between the oscillators. We show that this linear correlation translates into a linear dependence of the absorbance for low concentrations or molar oscillator strengths based on an approximation provided by Lorentz in 1906. Accordingly, Beer's law can be derived from dispersion theory.},

Collagen and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) aqueous gels were chosen to simulate a natural textile environment, wool and cotton, respectively. Isatin was found to be the major degradation product of indigo. In solution, the photodegradation quantum yields (ΦR) were in the order of 10−4, with the exception of aqueous media (ΦR = 9 × 10−6), and dependent on the irradiation wavelength. In the case of indigo carmine the ΦR values were found to suffer a 2-fold increase upon going from water to gels. The results indicate the absence of degradation products involving singlet oxygen and suggest peroxides, or other oxygen based radicals, to have a key role in the degradation of indigo. Finally, the relevance of the simulation is discussed by comparing the main degradation products to those found in the blues of millenary Andean textiles.},

Two instruments (the Signature Model Color-Eye and the Colormaster Model V) have been compared for precision in use consistent with speed, and the latter was favoured. Two ends from each piece were available and the best procedure for measurement was determined, taking into account the variations in colour across and along the piece. One measurement on four thicknesses of any specimen from an end of a piece is satisfactory, measured behind plain glass in a rotating-head, four specimens from each end being required to provide suitable average results for a piece. A consistent set of results for many pieces measured over several hours can best be obtained by the use of one specimen as a reference sample. Repeat measurements on the reference sample, every 30 min, enable the results for all pieces to be related by colour-difference measurements to a fixed point for the reference sample. This procedure compensates for significant variations in measured results for any specimen taken over periods longer than 15 min. There are insignificant variations in colour differences for a given pair of specimens over long periods when the pair are measured within a short period (ca 15 min). The instrumental results are consistent with the visual assessments and could be used for instrumental sorting. The colour variations among these pieces are essentially due to strength variations, and additional systems showing more random colour variations must be studied before a comprehensive sorting procedure can be considered.},

	abstract = {The multitude of areas in which diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can be applied has been described in several books and reviews and ranges from color measurements of textiles, pharmaceuticals, building materials, paper and pulp materials etc., to adsorption studies and other basic investigations in physical, inorganic and organic chemistry., The major area of application is still the measurement of color which has become indispensible in the quality control of colored products, dyes and pigments. Color matching practices and techniques with sophisticated instrumentation which can be fully computerized as well as the use of simpler filter instruments for quality control are mentioned., Transferability of reflectance data i.e., color coordinates, depends on the quality of standards particularly when absolute measurements are desired. The difficulty of finding suitable “white standards” with good reflection properties at low UV and with a good long term stability is discussed. Similar arguments hold for sphere coating materials. For the measurement of fluorescing surfaces suitable standards are lacking which renders transfer of such data almost impossible., The usefulness of diffuse reflectance techniques to study adsorption phenomena on small particle adsorbents is demonstrated with a malachite green-o-carboxylic acid lactone system studied by Kortüm. This or similar systems could be adopted to the measurement of relative surface areas on certain chromatographic adsorbents yielding more realistic values than the BET-method., The most recent area of application has been in the field of chromatography for the in situ evaluation of chromatographic zones in flat-bed chromatography, electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing., In chromatography, standardization is less problematic since usually relative measurements are sufficient. On the other hand one has to find suitable calibration procedures. The use of the Kubelka-Munk function is often questionable since we are usually not dealing with layers of infinite thickness and below 300 nm the conventional adsorbents such as silica gel, alumina or cellulose are strongly absorbing. Experiences with a new function combining the laws of Kubelka-Munk and Lambert-Beer are therefore presented., The problem is also to find calibration techniques which account for chromatographic parameters. Until recently it was believed that a quantitative evaluation of chromatograms required a number of reference zones to be developed on the same chromatogram. In our experience this is no longer true. A novel calibration technique which utilizes the concept of transferable calibration factors is discussed. With this approach a quantitative evaluation of a chromatogram with only one reference spot is possible. Here again scanning and data acquisition can be fully automated. The application of proper calibration procedures to differential reflectance techniques and the measurement of multi-component systems is briefly mentioned., Finally it is demonstrated that it is possible to carry out in situ quantitative measurements on low UV absorbing compounds (down to 190 nm) separated on silica gel surfaces, provided suitable techniques and instrumentation are used.},

This book gives a quantitative treatment of the physics of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with particulate media, such as powders and soils. Subjects covered include electromagnetic wave propagation, single particle scattering, diffuse reflectance, thermal emittance and polarisation. This new edition has been updated to include a quantitative treatment of the effects of porosity, a detailed discussion of the coherent backscatter opposition effect, a quantitative treatment of simultaneous transport of energy within the medium by conduction and radiation, and lists of relevant databases and software. This is an essential reference for research scientists, engineers and advanced students of planetary remote sensing.},

Electrons are lost (or donated) in oxidation, and gained (or accepted) in reduction. Oxidation of a species is caused by an oxidizing agent (or oxidant), which accepts electrons (and is thereby reduced). Similarly, reduction results from reaction with a reducing agent (or reductant), which donates electrons (and is oxidized). Reduction occurs primarily in water-saturated environments, such as sediments, soils, and sludge. Redox indicators can be used (1) as chemical probes to obtain fundamental insights into biogeochemical processes and (2) as the basis for demonstrations suitable for teaching aspects of environmental chemistry.},

	abstract = {Solar radiation at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths drives the chemistry of the atmosphere, by photo-dissociating relatively stable molecules into highly reactive radical fragments. Knowledge of photo-dissociation rate coefficients (J values) is crucial to understanding the behavior of global stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, the atmospheric lifetimes of gases such as carbon monoxide, methane, and non-methane hydrocarbons, and the formation of oxidants at urban and regional scales. J values depend on molecular parameters (absorption cross sections and photo-dissociation quantum yields) that are specific to the photo-reaction of interest, and on the availability of solar radiation at any specific location in the atmosphere. Advances in computer modeling of atmospheric radiative transfer now allow rapid calculation of J values for use in photo-chemistry models, and routinely include the effects of molecular absorbers and scatterers, clouds, aerosols, and surface reflections, for any location and time of the year. However, actual atmospheric conditions needed as input to the calculation are often not available. Direct measurements of J values, while in principle preferable, are technically difficult and limited in their temporal/spatial coverage, but generally support the theoretical calculations at least under optimal conditions (e. g., cloud free skies).},

	abstract = {The standard for measuring solar irradiance utilizes the units of watts per meter squared (W/m2). Irradiance meters are both costly and limited in the ability to measure low irradiance values. With a lower cost and higher sensitivity in low light conditions, light meters measure luminous flux per unit area (illuminance) utilizing the units of lumens per meter squared or lux (lx). An effective conversion factor between W/m2 and lx would enable the use of light meters to evaluate photovoltaic performance under low solar irradiance conditions. A survey of the literature found no definitive and readily available “rule of thumb” conversion standard between solar irradiance and illuminance. Easy-to-find Internet sources contain conflicting and widely varying values ranging from 688449 to 21000 lx for 1000 W/m2 (1 Sun) of solar irradiance. Peer-reviewed literature contains Luminous Efficacy equivalent values ranging from 21 to 131 lx per W/m2. This manuscript explores the relationship and establishes a theoretical and laboratory measurement guide for the conversion between solar irradiance and illuminance. The conversion factor includes standards data, equipment calibration accuracy, and uncertainty estimates. Solar Irradiance of 1 Sun (1000 W/m2) for an LED-based solar simulator is (116 ± 3) klx and (122 ± 1) klx for outdoor sunlight.},

	abstract = {Many studies have investigated light-induced damage to colourants in heritage collections using prepared samples of materials such as artist paints and dyed textiles. The body of research focuses primarily on the response of virgin materials, where colour change is assessed with respect to the original colour as light dose increases. From a practical perspective, most objects in museum collections have accumulated a significant light dose from illumination before acquisition, and subsequent years of exhibit lighting. When considering the risk of further degradation, it is often stated by heritage professionals that fugitive colourants with past light exposure are no longer as sensitive due to the slowing rate of visual damage. This is evident by studying ‘fading curves’, where the rate of colour change typically diminishes with increasing light dose. It remains unclear, however, to what degree the lightfastness of remaining colour changes with ongoing exposure. To address the issue, the light sensitivity of residual colour was investigated as a function of prior dose using a published dataset of colour measurements from textiles dyed with early synthetic colourants in the period of 1874–1905. The CIELAB colour values (D65/2°) for each material and dose increment were used to determine the future dose that causes a just-noticeable difference (JND), ΔE00 = 1.7, starting at different amounts of past exposure. This involved resetting the reference CIELAB values to that of the residual colour after each prior dose. The analysis provides an extension of our earlier work, where only the initial lightfastness was reported. A summary of the findings illustrates the shifting distribution of lightfastness, toward higher Blue Wool (BW) ratings with increasing exposure. As the dose progresses, dyes that start at BW1 sensitivity progress to BW2, then BW3 and so on. The findings from this work may assist with boundary approximations of object sensitivity when prior light exposure is known, or a reasonable estimate is available. An analysis of experimental data is summarised as a tool for this type of decision-making process.},

As a case study, a spectroscopic investigation in the 400-700 nm range is developed for Blue Wool Standard No. 1 (BWS1), a colorimetric indicator traditionally used by conservators to obtain a qualitative indication of the risk associated with lighting. Experiments using both artificial and natural light-aging were performed on BWS1 samples and a set of reflectance spectra was non-invasively collected during the aging process at increasing light-doses. A portable device based on fibre-optics technology, operating in real time, was used for the spectral acquisition. The problem of calibrating the BWS1 response to the light was investigated using the data-set of artificially light-aged samples, and different calibration models were compared. The calibration curves were then used to estimate the alteration, due to the possible synergistic action of light and other factors, which occurred in BWS1 samples naturally aged by exposure in situ. A method to account semi-quantitatively for the cumulative action of light and other environmental agents is proposed, by introducing the concept of 'equivalent light-dose', in terms of which the overall risk factor can be evaluated. /// On a étudié les aspects méthodologiques de l'utilisation de matériaux photosensibles comme indicateurs de dose de lumière dans le contexte du contrôle de l'environnement des musées.

Des expériences de vieillissement à la lumière artificielle aussi bien que naturelle ont été menées sur des échantillons de BWS1, et des spectres de réflectance ont été mesurés pendant le processus de vieillissement à des doses d'éclairage croissantes. Un instrument portable basé sur la technologie des fibres optiques fonctionnant en temps réel a été utilisé pour l'acquisition des spectres. Le problème de la calibration de la réponse du BWS1 à la lumière a été étudié en utilisant les données d'échantillons artificiellement vieillis à la lumière, et on a pu comparer différents modèles de calibration. Les courbes de calibration ont ensuite été utilisées pour estimer l'altération due à une possible action synergique de la lumière et d'autres facteurs sur des échantillons de BWS1 vieillis à la lumière naturelle par exposition in situ. On propose une méthode d'estimation semi-quantitative de l'action cumulée de la lumière et autres facteurs environnementaux en introduisant le concept d' " équivalent dose-lumière ", grâce auquel le facteur de risque peut être évalué dans son ensemble. /// Photosensitive Materialien, wie sie als Lichtdosimeter in Museen vielfach genutzt werden, wurden methodologisch untersucht.

Die Experimente zur lichtinduzierten Alterung des BWSI wurden sowohl in künstlichem wie in natürlichem Licht durchgeführt, wobei während des gemäß der ansteigenden Lichtdosis fortschreitenden Alterungsprozesses zerstörungsfrei Reflektionsspektren aufgenommen wurden. Dazu diente eine tragbare auf Glasfaseroptik basierende Einrichtung, die die Spektren in Echtzeit aufnahm. Zur Kalibrierung des BWSI dienten die Daten der in künstlichem Licht gealterten Proben. Dabei wurden verschiedene Kalibrierungsmodelle miteinander verglichen. Die Kalibrierungskurven wurden dann dazu genutzt, den Einfluß des Lichtes in Kombination mit anderen Faktoren abzuschätzen, wie er am BWSI Standard bei natürlicher in situ Alterung auftreten kann.

	abstract = {Library and Archives Canada (LAC) holds the two original
copies of the Proclamation of the Constitution Act, 1982 in
the collection. One was signed outdoors and exposed to water
droplets, and subsequently became known as the ‘Rain Drop’
copy. The second was signed indoors; however, it later suffered
intentional damage from an activist in 1983. This copy
is described as the ‘Red Paint’ or ‘Red Stain’ copy. Microfade
testing conducted in 2011 by the Canadian Conservation
Institute (CCI), concluded that the signature inks used on
both copies are highly light sensitive. This information,
coupled with an increasing demand for the long-term display
and loan of the objects, compelled LAC to collaborate
with CCI on the design of a pair of custom storage cases. The
enclosures were specifically developed with the capability of
maintaining low oxygen conditions for the duration of a typical
loan, since the technique has shown promise for slowing
the fading rate of many light-sensitive colourants.
The broader project included several sub-components:
design and construction of the sealed inner display case (or
storage case); design of a document mounting system suitable
for display and transportation; and procurement of a
specialized outer case that addressed additional functional
requirements. These elements are described in the context
of a loan that prompted rapid completion of the work. The
results of preliminary lightfastness testing of fountain pen
inks are also presented.},

The study also reviewed period photographic techniques with a focus on gold and “old hypo” toning. In addition to reflected light microscopy, analytical methods included X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Raman spectroscopy. Silver, gold and sulfur were found in association with the image material in these prints. All seven paper substrates were found to contain blue pigment inclusions - either smalt or ultramarine. Measurements taken with a spectrophotometer and microfading tester (MFT) were used to study light sensitivity and real-time color-change behavior. Overall, color measurements indicated that the salted paper prints were relatively stable with the exception of one unusual, bright yellow corner in a Calvert Jones print that contained silver and iodine. A comparison of real-time spectrophotometer and microfading tester measurements indicate that these results do not always correlate for silver-based photographs and requires further research.},

	abstract = {Rock art documentation is a complex task that should be carried out in a complete, rigorous and exhaustive way, in order to take particular actions that allow stakeholders to preserve the archaeological sites under constant deterioration. The pigments used in prehistoric paintings present high light sensitivity and rigorous scientific color degradation mapping is not usually undertaken in overall archaeological sites. Microfading spectrometry is a suitable technique for determining the light-stability of pigments found in rock art paintings in a non-destructive way. Spectral data can be transformed into colorimetric information following the recommendations published by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE). The fading degree can be evaluated through the color changes produced, computing both color and chromatic differences. Microfading Tester (MFT) measurements on spot samples are time-consuming and difficult to materialize on-site. This paper presents the results of statistical Gaussian process interpolation to map the potential MFT spectral variations overtime on a scene full of prehistoric rock art paintings. In addition, a descriptive analysis of color variations that may suffer the rock art motifs over time has been carried out. The advanced statistical methodology implemented can highlight potential changes on some rock support areas, and stable conditions on the painted red motifs over time, which can help to establish future conservation actions in the archaeological site.},

However, only a few studies on the interaction of light with the color of feathers have been published. This work provides fresh insight into the sensitivity of feathers for better conservation and exhibit of ethnographic collections, with a specific focus on carotenoids, psittacofulvins and porphyrins-based feathers. A first approach was to evaluate the use of Fiber Optics Reflectance Spectroscopy (FORS) in the visible range to characterize the chemical nature of the bio-pigments. It was implemented on 19 ornithological specimens preserved in the Muséum national d’histoire naturelle (MNHN) in Paris, and on assigned feathers from more than 40 objects from the collections of the musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac (mqB-JC). Then, microfading tests were carried out on molting feathers or picked up on dead birds. Two different setups were used in order to determine a reproducible protocol for these 3D materials. Several variables were considered including the positioning of the feather and the duration of measurements. In addition to the visible range, the near-infrared (NIR) region was also investigated to determine if the color fading is concomitant to any structural modification. Then the developed protocol was applied on some loose lumps of feathers from objects of the mqB-JC collections. The data were compared against each other and to the Blue Wool Standards fading rates.},

The three spectroscopic techniques complement each other in pigment identification. Multispectral imaging (near infrared bands), OCT and micro-Raman complement each other in the visualisation and identification of the drawing material. OCT probes the microstructure and light scattering properties of the substrate while XRF detects the elemental composition that indicates the sizing methods and the filler content. The multiple techniques were applied in a study of forty six 19th century Chinese export watercolours from the Victoria \& Albert Museum (V\&A) and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) to examine to what extent the non-invasive analysis techniques employed complement each other and how much useful information about the paintings can be extracted to address art conservation and history questions.

	abstract = {Māori are the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand. Textiles produced by Māori have high cultural importance and aesthetic appeal and are consequently often on display, despite being thought to be vulnerable to photodegradation, with loss of colour and fibre embrittlement reported for artefacts held in collections worldwide. Consequently, these textiles are managed as ‘sensitive category’ artefacts when exhibited, despite a lack of information regarding their specific response to light. This project used multiple techniques to assess the influence of light exposure on colour, tensile properties and molecular structure of dyed muka [fibre commonly found in Māori textile artefacts; non-dyed, tanekaha (red/tan dye), paru (black dye)]. A combination of accelerated light-ageing (conventional mercury vapour and microfading), tensile testing, attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) and Raman spectroscopy techniques were applied. Tanekaha-dyed muka was the least light fast in comparison to other dye types (tanekaha/non-dyed/paru: fading rate equivalent to ISO Blue Wool standard 1-2/3-4/3-4, one just noticeable fade at 0.4/3.6/10 Mlux hours, respectively). Light exposure (10 Mlux hours) decreased the tensile properties (tenacity, extensibility and toughness) of paru-dyed muka only, with this dye type also demonstrating lesser tensile properties compared to other dye types prior to light exposure. ATR-IR spectra combined with partial lest squares regression (PLSR) indicated tanekaha-dyed muka had some detectable chemical changes correlated with light aging (PLSR model slope=0.69, RMSE=1.7 and R2=0.68). No correlation was found for non- and paru-dyed muka spectra (PLSR model slopes≤0.45, RMSE{\textgreater}2.5 and R2≤0.4). Although Māori textiles containing dyed muka are generally assigned to a sensitive category for museum display, the results from this study suggest that these textiles are more stable to light than previously thought, particularly non- and paru-dyed muka. Despite fears held by museum practitioners that colour change while on exhibition is also indicative of other degradation, results did not support this contention. Furthermore, the study enabled comparison of results gained by two methods of artificial ageing (conventional light-ageing and microfading) increasing researcher confidence about making recommendations to museums and furthering knowledge about new techniques of establishing light stability when on display.},

The authors investigated Red-shafted Flicker feathers, which have carotenoid-based colorant systems and significance in North American native regalia, to demonstrate how lighting guidelines could be informed by a multivariate approach that considers material sensitivity, properties of value, and use before entering a museum collection. Ornithological literature reviewed demonstrates that feathers are highly differentiated in their sources of coloration, which include chemistry, structure, diet, age and gender, all resulting in varying responses to illumination. The authors explore the value placed on color by original fabricators, and how use and attitudes toward color contribute to the collections for which we assume stewardship. Red-shafted Flicker feathers were exposed to equivalent photometric doses in order to compare results from window-fading and microfading to Blue Wool Standards. Results indicate color changes more stable than Blue Wool 1 and 2, with ultraviolet radiation playing a significant role in fading. Microfading is beneficial for measuring color change because the variability within and between feathers is eliminated as the sample site remains unvaried.},

This article reports experimental work testing the efficacy of sodium alginate, a consolidant developed for deteriorated paru-dyed muka (fibre from harakeke; Phormium tenax). The colour stability, strength retention, and acidity of paru-dyed muka consolidated with sodium alginate (0.25, 0.5, and 1\% w/v in water) was tested pre- and post-artificial light ageing. This study found that sodium alginate had no negative effect on paru-dyed muka and in some cases provided benefit. Interestingly, the colour of paru-dyed muka is substantially more stable in UV-filtered light than previously recognised. Also microfading results were in agreement with visual assessments of colour change at 1 Mlux hour exposure, providing confidence in this relatively new technique to assess colour change.},

The wavelength dependence of the dyes’ emissive properties has also led to their use in works meant to be displayed under nontraditional high energy light sources, such as blacklights. The intended display methods and the photochemistry of the constituent dyes can lead to chemical instability and also pose unique challenges for conservation and exhibition. In Part 1 of this research, we reported on the chemical constituents of colorants from two major manufacturers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive report of the spectral properties and lightfastness of paints prepared with the pigments. The optical properties and chemical stability of these colorants are correlated with the composition. Variation in composition can lead to unique markers that could be useful for conservation treatment and exhibition considerations. Changes in the dyes used in the pigment formulation over time are considered in the comparison of two objects: a Stephen Sprouse silvered leather motorcycle jacket featuring fluorescent art by Stefano Castronovo and selections from the Day-Glo Designer’s Guide from 1969.},

	abstract = {Birch bark is commonly found in indigenous collections in Canadian museums. It is empirically known that light can cause the cambium side of birch bark to change colour. The purpose of this research is to better assess the light sensitivities of various colours of birch barks, and the manner, degree, and rate of colour change during light exposure. Six barks with different colours were used: beige, yellow, orange, orange-brown, red, and brown. Samples were exposed to daylight through a north-facing window (window), LED light from an enclosed chamber (LED), and the Newport-Oriel microfade tester (MFT). Window and MFT samples received a total light dose of approximately 25 Mlux-hours, and LED samples, 182 Mlux-hours. Colour monitoring of the samples showed that almost all barks initially darkened and then faded. Daylight through window caused the most rapid and extensive darkening and fading. Bluewool (BW) ratings for window samples were the lowest (most light sensitive). The MFT and LED samples showed a similar degree of colour change, with the same dose, despite the difference in intensity. Ratings of MFT samples are within one BW step difference compared to LED samples. The rate and extent of initial darkening depended on the colour of the bark; the middle range orange-toned barks showed the most rapid and extensive darkening followed by fading.},

	abstract = {All color-difference formulas are developed to evaluate color differences for pairs of stimuli with hairline separation. In printing applications, however, color differences are frequently judged between a pair of samples with no separation (NS) because they are printed adjacently on the same piece of paper. A new formula, \&\#x0394;ENS, has been developed for pairs of stimuli with NS. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of different color-difference magnitudes using sample pairs with NS. 1012 printed pairs with NS were prepared around 11 CIE recommended color centers. The pairs, representing four color-difference magnitudes of 1, 2, 4, and 8 CIELAB units were visually evaluated by a panel of 19 observers using the gray-scale method. Comparison of the present data based on pairs with NS, and previously generated data using pairs with hairline separation, showed a clear separation effect. A new color-difference equation for the NS viewing condition (\&\#x0394;ENS) is proposed by modifying the CIEDE2000 formula. The separation effect can be well described by the new formula. For a sample pair with NS, when the CIEDE2000 color difference is less than 9.1, a larger color difference leads to a larger lightness difference, but has no effect on the chromatic difference. When the CIEDE2000 color difference is greater than 9.1, the effect is the opposite. The new formula is recommended for future research to evaluate its performance in appropriate applications.},

	abstract = {What is conservation? Simplistic as it may seem, this question has many possible answers. Today, conservation no longer aims simply to prolong its objects’ material lives into the future. It is seen as an engagement with materiality, rather than material—that is, with the many specific factors determining how objects’ identity and meaning are entangled with the aspects of time, the environment, ruling values, politics, economy, conventions and culture. Additionally, beyond the concerns with objects, conservation now also engages with subjects, and the accompanying notions of the transmission of skill, tradition, memory and tacit knowledge. By glimpsing into the theories past and present, this paper argues that conservation is a complex techno-cultural practice with a strong, retroactive impact on its objects and subjects. Conservation offers an invaluably rich context to study a man-made world. Simultaneously, it allows us to pursue fundamental epistemic questions related to what, when and how artworks exist in the world and how our engagement with them is contingent upon the prevailing cultural–historical conditions.},

	abstract = {This article challenges a dominant narrative of conservation: that keeping things for longer is better. Approaches common in the heritage sector, such as risk management, support cautious patterns of behaviour that generate unintended consequences that can create further barriers to already excluded groups. Museums control and shape how present-day users engage with each other through their collections, but conservators can become disconnected from this process because of our concern about protecting value for future unspecified users. Conservators cannot opt out of taking sides when faced with cultural inequality, and must either accept or challenge it. Predicating actions for unknown future beneficiaries is neither always necessary nor positive and unless we change our practices and acknowledge past inequalities, users of the future will look a lot like users of today, with the current exclusions as described by the ‘decolonise the museum movement’ remaining endorsed. Creating a positive goal for conservation by creating connections with and via collections enables conservation to contribute to current participatory museum practices. If conservators re-position their perspective from a commitment to extending the lifetimes of objects to extending the life-experiences generated by them, they can offer a focus in which past inequality rather than future beneficiaries becomes a determining criterion of how long we keep things. By way of a brief overview of relevant theory, the article is intended as a call-to-action for conservators to join debates about cultural rights, oppression and privilege raging in and around the heritage sector.},

Since its publication by the Dutch Foundation for the Conservation of Contemporary Art (SBMK, Stichting Behoud Moderne Kunst) the model has served as a valuable tool when navigating through complex problems in the conservation of modern and contemporary art, as well as fordiscussing and documenting decision-making processes and training young professionals. Nevertheless, new contemporary art forms as well as recent research results have revealed a need for its revision. To meet this need, Cologne Institute for Conservation Science (CICS) organized two workshops in conjunction withthe Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (RCE, Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed) and Maastricht University (MU). Members of the group were professionals from the fields of conservation, cultural heritage preservation, art history, philosophy, and decision theory as well as researchers from the training programme New Approaches in the Conservation of Contemporary Art (NACCA). This paper summarizes the results and proposes an extended decision-making model that will be further tested in the near future.},

	abstract = {Edvard Munch (1863–1944) is well represented worldwide, but the National Museum of Art is the first Norwegian public institution to have collected, endorsed, displayed and conserved
Munch’s art during his lifetime. The 57 paintings, acquired over a 79-year period (1891–1970), are still regarded as the most iconic ensemble in the museum. Since 1909, these paintings have been presented as a single-artist collection and exhibited through the curated Munch Room display concept. Between 1909 and 1993 many of the unvarnished paintings were
controversially varnished.
This thesis aims to gain knowledge about the painted surfaces and non-original varnishes in this Munch collection. A group case study was used to establish the historical context and a non-invasive methodological approach explored for the technical investigations. The conservator’s perspective was key in the choice of user-friendly, cost-effective and practical examination techniques. Portable Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography were tested as the two main diagnostic techniques. The theoretical framework of
‘object itineraries’ was employed to trace the conservation narratives of the paintings over time. 

The findings contextualise and give a more objective perspective of the museum’s past varnish practice. A complete varnish survey of the collection (1909–2019) was created, and three
varnish time periods were identified as relevant historical markers. The diagnostic techniques helped to shed new light on Munch’s painting technique and surface effects from his earlier
period (1884–1900). Finally, the four interlinked papers contribute to a decision-making model with a flexible design framework that can be adapted to similar collections.

In sum, this thesis provides knowledge about non-original varnishes and the conservation history of this Munch collection. Moreover, it contributes to our knowledge of conservation
methodology, long-term care, decision-making strategies and the base of Munch’s artistic legacy.},

Two years later, he wrote 'Contemporary Theory of Conservation', a different, revised version of the first work. In these books, the philosophy of conservation was analyzed, and, building from different authors and sources, an alternative approach was outlined. Since 2005, the author has continued working on this topic, revising the ideas presented in these books, and developing new ones. Many of these ideas were presented in papers or in lectures. 'On Theoretical and Ethical Principles of Conservation' gathers together fifteen of these contributions.0While the papers and lectures included in this volume were not conceived as part of a whole, a coherent line of thinking can be easily detected: in all of them, the core notions of conservation ethics are discussed and analyzed. In different ways, they all aim at showing that, simply put, the so-called "principles of conservation" are not what they may seem at first sight. Heritage conservation is a well-established activity in many societies -- an activity that does work, and that serves its purposes in an overly successful way; however, the reflections presented in this volume suggest that conservation might benefit from a different, less traditional interpretation of some of its ethical and theoretical tenets.},

Preventive conservation now takes a greater proportion of conservators’ time and this shift in employment opportunities is reflected in college curricula. Despite a recent reaffirmation of the importance of treatment, the underlying problems with educational infrastructure and heritage funding mean that practical skills are still at risk. In this context there is a slow drift in the interpretation of ethical guidance, which leads to a conservative view of what can or should be achieved. This drift may be a sign of purposeful progress or it may merely result from aimless indifference. In either case it may be possible to control the rate of change by altering attitudes to regulation and by encouraging individuals to express in detail their personal ethical beliefs rather than relying on shifting interpretations of general ethical principles.},

The present study investigates Rothko's creative process, materials, and technique with ultraviolet and infrared imaging, analytical chemistry, cross-sectional analysis, and comparisons with the literature. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy imaging of cross sections help with the chemical mapping of the paint stratifications. A comparison of paper studies, studies on canvas, and the final five works installed give a detailed insight into Rothko's editing process. The intimate relationship between works on paper and canvas is traced by uncovering a back and forth between the two media, and the mixing of dry pigment with binder is a common theme for works on both supports. Motif developments, changes, and distinct painting campaigns become apparent with ultraviolet induced visible fluorescence imaging and infrared reflected infrared digital photography. Color measurements and microfading experiments give insight into the stability and light sensitivity of the materials used by Rothko in the Harvard Murals.},

On the basis of the growing interest in the understanding of the discoloration mechanism of eosin-based lakes, this study compares the ability of two ultrafast and ultrasensitive mass spectrometry techniques to detect eosin derivatives in complex matrices, such as oil media without the use of conventional separation columns or additional sample preparation protocols. Direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) and direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DI-ESI-MS) were used to characterize the degradation pathway of eosin in oil media. The analysis protocols developed in this study are applied to discern the degradation mechanism of the lake pigment eosin (comprising the molecule per se complexed to an inorganic substrate) dispersed in linseed oil to create an oil paint. The analysis of oil paints by high resolution MS without an extraction methodology that modifies the system chemistry allowed us to identify the degradation forms without causing any additional fragmentation. Both techniques revealed the primary photodegradation pathway of eosin in linseed oil, and DI-ESI-MS provided additional information on the native conformation of the lake.},

Such a problem had never before been noticed in Yugoslavian paintings of the 20th century. Discolored areas were found in various locations on the paint layer of the painting “Untitled” (especially on the lower and central parts of the painting), which disturbed the visual experience of the artistic work. To discover the cause of this discoloration, the composition of the paint layer was investigated, with the assumption that the true cause of degradation was hidden therein. Moreover, this painting belongs to a specific period in Vozarević’s activity, characterized by the use of non-traditional painting materials. To identify pigments from the highly degraded painting “Untitled”, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS) and micro-Raman spectroscopy were applied. Lithol red, a synthetic organic pigment known to give paintings a red tone, was identified as the main reason for the painting’s degradation. Lithol red is not only highly light-sensitive but is also chemically unstable, toxic, and sensitive to heat.},

With the rapid advances in mass spectrometry technology and methods, it has become imperative to provide a standard output format for mass spectrometry data that will facilitate data sharing and analysis. Initially, the efforts to develop a standard format for mass spectrometry data resulted in multiple formats, each designed with a different underlying philosophy. To resolve the issues associated with having multiple formats, vendors, researchers, and software developers convened under the banner of the HUPO PSI to develop a single standard. The new data format incorporated many of the desirable technical attributes from the previous data formats, while adding a number of improvements, including features such as a controlled vocabulary with validation tools to ensure consistent usage of the format, improved support for selected reaction monitoring data, and immediately available implementations to facilitate rapid adoption by the community. The resulting standard data format, mzML, is a well tested open-source format for mass spectrometer output files that can be readily utilized by the community and easily adapted for incremental advances in mass spectrometry technology.},

Exploring the complex mass spectral data or filtering the unwanted signal is tedious whether performed manually or automatically. In contrast, the now 60-year-old Kendrick (mass defect) analysis, when adapted to polymer ions, produces visual two-dimensional maps with intuitive alignments of the repetitive patterns and favourable deconvolution of features overlaid in the one-dimensional mass spectrum. This special feature article reports on an up-to-date and theoretically sound use of Kendrick plots as a data processing tool. The approach requires no prior knowledge of the sample but offers promising dynamic capabilities for visualizing, filtering, and sometimes assigning congested mass spectra. Examples of applications of the approach to polymers are discussed throughout the text, but the same tools can be readily extended to other applications, including the analysis of polymers present as pollutants/contaminants, and to other analytes incorporating a repetitive moiety, for example, oils or lipids. In each of these instances, data processing can benefit from the application of an updated and interactive Kendrick analysis.},

We used the dataset which was obtained from 19 pigments. The dataset has scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient of each pigment. We applied Kubelka-Munk theory to the coefficients to obtain many patterns of spectral data.

	abstract = {Visual uncertainty, while reported, is not used routinely when evaluating color-difference formula performance in comparison with visual data; rather, data are analyzed assuming no uncertainty; that is, repeating the experiment would result in the identical average results. Previously, Shen and Berns developed three methods to determine whether a color-difference formula was well-fitting, under-fitting, or over-fitting visual data when visual uncertainty was considered, the method dependent on how the uncertainty was reported and the colorimetric sampling of the color-difference stimuli. The “nonellipsoid standard error method” was used in the current analyses. Three datasets were evaluated: BFD-P, Leeds, and Witt. For the BFD-P data, incorporating visual uncertainty led to the same performance results as the average results, that CIEDE2000 was an improvement over CIE94, which was an improvement over CIELAB. For the Witt data, incorporating visual uncertainty led to the same performance results as the average results, that CIEDE2000 and CIE94 had equivalent performance, both an improvement over CIELAB. However, both formulas under-fitted the visual results; thus, neither formula was optimal. For the Leeds dataset, the visual uncertainty analysis did not support the improvement of CIEDE2000 over CIE94 that occurred when evaluating the average results. Both formulas well fit the visual data. These analyses also provided insight into the tradeoffs between the number of color-difference pairs and the number of observations when fitting a local contour of equal perceived color difference: In particular, increasing the number of observations was more important than increasing the number of color-difference pairs. Finally, average standard error could be used to approximate visual uncertainty defined using STRESS. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 2011},

The spectral reflectance of any pixel was reconstructed based on pigment concentrations. Thus the colorimetric values under different viewing conditions could be calculated based on reconstructed reflectance spectra. Pigment concentrations were estimated using a look up table; then another look up table was utilized to estimate the colorimetric values under the desire viewing condition. Hence, two look up tables were built to connect concentration and CIELAB color values based on one-constant Kubelka-Munk theory for opaque layers. Out of gamut color as well as non-linearly between concentration values and CIELAB coordinates were accounted for. Reflectance data for Xrite ColorChecker classic and SG were used to evaluate the workflow. At the end ICC profiles are applied to a test image of a painting to estimate its appearance under different light sources. This technique is useful for simulating a work of art's appearance as an aid for lighting design using common picture editing software such as Photoshop.},

Since then, with continuous improvements in imaging technology, the quality of spectroscopic information in the acquired imaging data has greatly increased. Moreover, with the progressive transition from multispectral to hyperspectral imaging techniques, numerous new applicative perspectives have become possible, ranging from non-invasive monitoring to high-quality documentation, such as mapping and characterization of polychrome and multi-material surfaces of cultural properties. This article provides a brief overview of recent developments in the rapidly evolving applications of hyperspectral imaging in this field. The fundamentals of the various strategies, that have been developed for applying this technique to different types of artworks are discussed, together with some examples of recent applications.},

	abstract = {Reflectance hyperspectral imaging provides a non-invasive tool for the diagnostics, analysis and documentation of paintings. It supplies high quality digital images with spectral information associated to each pixel of the imaged area. Working in the short-wave infrared range (1000–2500 nm) allows for the investigation of inner layers of paintings, by revealing underdrawings, hidden details, and characterizing artists’ materials. The performance of spectral imaging systems is usually established in the laboratory using reference targets to measure the system spatial and spectral resolution. However, when dealing with paintings, using custom built test targets made with materials more representative of the artwork can provide a better understanding of advantages and limitations of the system. This paper looks at the benefits of hyperspectral imaging in the 900–1700 nm region as applied to the study of paintings. A test panel target, made according to early Renaissance Florentine painting techniques was used for assessing the diagnostic capability of the hyperspectral system developed at the “Nello Carrara” Institute of Applied Physics. The paper illustrates how different spatial and spectral resolutions can impact the documentation of underdrawings and identification of artists’ materials. Finally, the analysis of a fifteenth-century panel painting by Fra Angelico is presented as case study.},

	abstract = {Paper is a material known to everybody. It has a network structure consisting of wood fibres that can be mimicked by cooking a portion of spaghetti and pouring it on a plate, to form a planar assembly of fibres that lie roughly horizontal. Real paper also contains other constituents added for technical purposes. This review has two main lines of thought. First, in the introductory part, we consider the physics that one encounters when ‘using’ paper, an everyday material that exhibits the presence of disorder. Questions arise, for instance, as to why some papers are opaque and others translucent, some are sturdy and others sloppy, some readily absorb drops of liquid while others resist the penetration of water. The mechanical and rheological properties of paper and paperboard are also interesting. They are inherently dependent on moisture content. In humid conditions paper is ductile and soft, in dry conditions brittle and hard. In the second part we explain in more detail research problems concerned with paper. We start with paper structure. Paper is made by dewatering a suspension of fibres starting from very low content of solids. The processes of aggregation, sedimentation and clustering are familiar from statistical mechanics. Statistical growth models or packing models can simulate paper formation well and teach a lot about its structure. The second research area that we consider is the elastic and viscoelastic properties and fracture of paper and paperboard. This has traditionally been the strongest area of paper physics. There are many similarities to, but also important differences from, composite materials. Paper has proved to be convenient test material for new theories in statistical fracture mechanics. Polymer physics and memory effects are encountered when studying creep and stress relaxation in paper. Water is a ‘softener’ of paper. In humid conditions, the creep rate of paper is much higher than in dry conditions. The third among our topics is the interaction of paper with water. The penetration of water into paper is an interesting transport problem because wood fibres are hygroscopic and swell with water intake. The porous fibre network medium changes as the water first penetrates into the pore space between the fibres and then into the fibres. This is an area where relatively little systematic research has been done. Finally, we summarize our thoughts on paper physics.},

	abstract = {The performance of many products such as those made of containerboard or other paperboards is sensitive to moisture. Transient moisture profiles result in heterogeneities in mechanical properties and can often lead to catastrophic failure. Viewed as a composite porous medium the system comprises hygroscopic fibers and void spaces both of which are continuous. Furthermore, both phases conduct moisture by diffusion and for typical paperboards diffusion through the fiber matrix predominates at high moisture contents whereas vapor phase diffusion through the void space is dominant at lower values. Depending upon the external and initial conditions, competition between these two pathways and local sorption interplay and produce interesting effects, which can have significant impact on the mechanical performance of the composite medium. In order to delineate the different effects that can occur, we used a mathematical model for unsteady state diffusion to analyze the case of transient moisture transport through a paperboard exposed to differential humidity conditions on either side. Diffusion is assumed to occur along the thickness direction in the void space and in the fiber space. Local uptake of moisture is represented by the linear driving force approximation. A numerical solution of the mathematical model is sought. The dominant path for moisture transport can undergo a change from the fibers to the void spaces under large humidity differentials. A fiber conduction layer whose thickness develops with time and reaches a constant value at steady state is found. This raises the possibility of moisture response, which could depend on the direction of diffusion for significantly heterogeneous media. Another interesting feature is the development of minima in the moisture flux versus time curves, which are sensitive to the diffusion and local sorption parameters. Tracking such minima can provide a good method to tune the model parameters based on experimental flux data. The role of the interfacial region between the layers can affect the overall resistance and alter moisture content profiles significantly. Since similar ‘two-equation’ models have been proposed for other transport processes such as heat and momentum transfer, these results can have wider applicability. In particular, steady and unsteady profiles and fluxes can be exploited to yield information about the local and global transport coefficients for the heterogeneous medium under consideration.},

Paperboard is viewed as an orthotropic triphasic porous medium consisting of fibers, bound water and moist air. Furthermore, the moist air is considered as a mixture of two miscible gases, namely dry air and water vapor. A two–scale hybrid mixture theory is adopted in a large strain setting and balances of mass, linear momentum, and energy are presented on the macroscale. Constitutive relations are derived on the macroscale through exploitation of the dissipation inequality. Mass exchange between bound water and water vapor is included as a dynamic process. Mass transportation processes include chemical potential driven diffusion and nonlinear seepage flow. The elasto–plastic stress–strain response of the fiber network is described by assuming a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient associated with the motion of the fiber network. The dynamics related to the mass exchange between bound water and water vapor is illustrated by changes of pressure, relative humidity, moisture ratio, and rate of evaporation during rapid heating of a moist paperboard.},

	abstract = {Some current models for moisture diffusion in paper in the hygroscopic range are analyzed. In general, two types of diffusion models can be recognized. Models of the first type treat paper as a homogeneous medium with moisture flux that is proportional to the gradient in moisture content. Although useful in some instances this approach fails frequently because it homogenizes the internal dynamics and relaxation processes occurring within the paper material. Recent studies have shown that a subtler approach which treats paper as a composite of fibers and void spaces is more successful at describing moisture transport dynamics. A review of these studies along with a generalization of this approach to three dimensions is considered here. The parameters appearing in such models can be identified with the physical processes of diffusion through the void space and through the fiber matrix. Diffusivities in these individual phases are supplemented by a local kinetic coefficient representing moisture flux interchange between the void and fiber phases. When the local moisture exchange coefficient takes on large values, the fibers and the void spaces are at local equilibrium with no net exchange of moisture. Under such conditions, the model reduces to the simpler Fickian diffusion model with nonlinear moisture diffusivity equivalent to earlier models.},

	abstract = {ConspectusDiffuse reflectance hyperspectral imaging, or reflectance imaging spectroscopy, is a sophisticated technique that enables the capture of hundreds of images in contiguous narrow spectral bands (bandwidth {\textless} 10 nm), typically in the visible (Vis, 400–750 nm) and the near-infrared (NIR, 750–2500 nm) regions. This sequence of images provides a data set that is called an image-cube or file-cube. Two dimensions of the image-cube are the spatial dimensions of the scene, and the third dimension is the wavelength. In this way, each spatial pixel in the image has an associated reflectance spectrum. This “big data” image-cube allows for the mining of artists’ materials and mapping their distribution across the surface of a work of art.Reflectance hyperspectral imaging, introduced in the 1980s by Goetz and co-workers, led to a revolution in the field of remote sensing of the earth and near planets (Goetz, F. H.; Vane, G.; Solomon, B. N.; Rock, N. Imaging Spectrometry for Earth Remote Sensing. Science, 1985, 228, 1147−1152). In the subsequent decades, thanks to rapid advances in solid-state sensor technology, reflectance hyperspectral imaging, once only available to large government laboratories, was extended to new fields of application, such as monitoring agri-foods, pharmaceutical products, the environment, and cultural heritage. In the 2000s, the potential of this noninvasive technology for the study of artworks became evident and, consequently, the methodology is becoming more widely used in the art conservation science field.Typically hyperspectral reflectance image-cubes contain millions of spectra. Many of these spectra are similar, making the reduction of the data set size an important first step. Thus, image-processing tools based on multivariate techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), automated classification methods, or expert knowledge systems, that search for known spectral features are often applied. These algorithms seek to reduce the large number of high-quality spectra to a common subset, which allow identifying and mapping artists’ materials and alteration products. Hence, reflectance hyperspectral imaging is finding its place as the starting point to find sites on polychrome surfaces for spot analytical techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Reflectance hyperspectral imaging can also provide image products that are a mainstay in the art conservation field, such as color-accurate images, broadband near-infrared images, and false-color products.This Account reports on the research activity carried out by two research groups, one at the “Nello Carrara” Institute of Applied Physics of the Italian National Research Council (IFAC–CNR) in Florence and the other at the National Gallery of Art (NGA) in Washington, D.C. Both groups have conducted parallel research, with frequent interchanges, to develop multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems to study works of art. In the past decade, they have designed and experimented with some of the earliest spectral imaging prototypes for museum applications. In this Account, a brief presentation of the hyperspectral sensor systems is given with case studies showing how reflectance hyperspectral imaging is answering key questions in cultural heritage.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in bringing non-invasive laboratory-based analytical imaging tools to field sites to study wall paintings in order to collect molecular information on the macroscale. Analytical imaging tools, such as reflectance imaging spectrometry, have provided a wealth of information about artist materials and working methods, as well as painting conditions. Currently, scientific analyses of wall paintings have been limited to point-measurement techniques such as reflectance spectroscopy (near-ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared), X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy. Macroscale data collection methods have been limited to multispectral imaging in reflectance and luminescence modes, which lacks sufficient spectral bands to allow for the mapping and identification of artist materials of interest. The development of laboratory-based reflectance and elemental imaging spectrometers and scanning systems has sparked interest in developing truly portable versions, which can be brought to field sites to study wall paintings where there is insufficient space or electrical power for laboratory instruments. This paper presents the design and testing of a simple hyperspectral system consisting of a 2D spatial spot scanning spectrometer, which provides high spectral resolution diffuse reflectance spectra from 350 to 2500 nm with high signal to noise and moderate spatial resolution (few mm). This spectral range at high spectral resolution was found to provide robust chemical specificity sufficient to identify and map many artists’ materials, as well as the byproducts of weathering and conservation coatings across the surface of ancient and Byzantine Cypriot wall paintings. Here, we present a detailed description of the hyperspectral system, its performance, and examples of its use to study wall paintings from Roman tombs in Cyprus. The spectral/spatial image processing workflow to make maps of pigments and constituent painting materials is also discussed. This type of configurable hyperspectral system and the imaging processing workflow offer a new tool for the field study of wall paintings and other immovable heritage.},

A growing scientific literature definitely demonstrated the effectiveness of reflectance hyperspectral imaging for non-invasive diagnostics and highquality documentation of 2D artworks. Additional published studies tackle the problems of data-processing, with a focus on the development of algorithms and software platforms optimised for visualisation and exploitation of hyperspectral bigdata sets acquired on paintings. This scenario proves that, also in the field of Cultural Heritage (CH), reflectance hyperspectral imaging has nowadays reached the stage of mature technology, and is ready for the transition from the R\&amp;D phase to the large-scale applications. In view of that, a novel concept of hyperspectral camera - featuring compactness, lightness and good usability - has been developed by SPECIM, Spectral Imaging Ltd. (Oulu, Finland), a company in manufacturing products for hyperspectral imaging. The camera is proposed as new tool for novel applications in the field of Cultural Heritage. The novelty of this device relies in its reduced dimensions and weight and in its user-friendly interface, which make this camera much more manageable and affordable than conventional hyperspectral instrumentation. The camera operates in the 400-1000nm spectral range and can be mounted on a tripod. It can operate from short-distance (tens of cm) to long distances (tens of meters) with different spatial resolutions. The first release of the prototype underwent a preliminary in-depth experimentation at the IFAC-CNR laboratories. This paper illustrates the feasibility study carried out on the new SPECIM hyperspectral camera, tested under different conditions on laboratory targets and artworks with the specific aim of defining its potentialities and weaknesses in its use in the Cultural Heritage field.},

	abstract = {This work explores the potential of a compact hyperspectral camera, Specim IQ, for the remote colorimetric study of polychrome surfaces in controlled environments. These measurements are generally made with dedicated instruments, such as colorimeters or spectrophotometers, which require contact with the surface and coverage areas of the order of 10s of mm2. These two characteristics, contact and a very small analysis area, can severely limit the study of polychrome surfaces, since the measured areas are not necessarily representative of the entire surface. In addition, it is not always possible to touch the objects being analyzed. A possible alternative is the use of compact hyperspectral cameras, such as Specim IQ, for the in situ study of the spectral and colorimetric characteristics of these surfaces. To better address this research, which is still in the preliminary phase, a 2 × 45°/0° geometry measuringement was used. The illumination of the image plane at 45° with respect to the camera made it possible to eliminate the components reflected specularly on the camera lens. With this shooting geometry, Labsphere Color and Gray Reflectance Standards (eight color and four gray standards) were analyzed and placed on seven different color backgrounds. With the spectral data acquired, it was possible to calculate the color of the targets and display the colorimetric values by means of three commonly used image processing software packages. In this way, it was possible to define for this hyperspectral camera a measurement-data processing procedure applicable to measurements in the laboratory aimed at studying the color of polychrome surfaces.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a decade of work on digital imaging for museums. From 1989 to 1992, the visual arts system for archiving and retrieval of images (VASARI) project produced a digital-imaging system that made color-calibrated images of up to 20000/spl times/20000 pixels directly from paintings. It used seven color-separation bands in the visible region, resulting in an average color error of around 1 /spl Delta/E*/sub ab/ unit. These images have since been used to monitor the condition of paintings, document paintings during conservation treatment, including predicting appearance after cleaning, reconstruct the original appearance of paintings in which pigments have faded, and assess whether paintings have been damaged during transportation, in estimations of the surface reflectance spectra and in the printing of high-quality reproductions. We have applied similar techniques to museum infrared and X-ray imaging. To manage the images produced by the VASARI system, an image-processing package has been developed that is tailored for very large colorimetric images. This package has since been used in several other projects, including a remote image viewer designed to provide internet access to high-resolution images. The paper explores these developments and gives details of the current generation of VASARI-derived systems, set in the context of the state of the art for museum imaging.},

Up to date, a variety of non-imaging and imaging hyperspectral sensors is available. The measuring process and the handling of most of these sensors is rather complex.

Basic data handling and data analysis processes, such as pre-processing and classification routines are implemented within the camera software.

	abstract = {Mixture theory is used to derive a triphasic model to describe processes in paperboard consisting of solid fiber, bound water and gas. The gas is viewed as a miscible mix of the two constituents dry air and water vapor. The governing equations are mass conservation laws for bound water, dry air, water vapor, and mixture energy balance. Constitutive relations are found by exploiting the macroscale dissipation inequality. Resulting constitutive equations include Fickian diffusion of water vapor and dry air, Darcian flow for gas and Fourier heat conduction for the mixture. Mass exchange between bound water, and water vapor due to adsorption/desorption is driven by the difference in chemical potential. The interaction function is based on equilibrium considerations for the bound water–water vapor system. From the description of the sorption isotherm, expressions for net isosteric heat and free energy related to water–fiber interaction are derived. The resulting thermodynamically consistent model is used to simulate moisture and heat dynamics for paperboard rolls. Simulation results are presented for a paperboard roll with anisotropic material properties subjected to a change in ambient relative humidity from 50 to 80 \%.},

	abstract = {The exhibition Cézanne Drawing at The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) brought together an exceptional group of works on paper from public and private collections across the globe. Recognizing the inherent light sensitivity of both the paper and watercolors, controlling, and tracking light exposure was central to the exhibition planning. This concern also led to a systematic study of three watercolors in the museum’s collection, Foliage (1895), Study of Trees (1895), and Mont Sainte-Victoire (1902-06), to characterize the watercolor paints used by Cezanne in these works and their sensitivity to light exposure, and to better understand the condition of the drawings based on the palette’s chemistry. Examination and analysis were undertaken non-invasively and micro-invasively with the following techniques: Infrared Reflectography (IRR), Ultraviolet Fluorescence Photography (UVF), Raman and surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) spectroscopies in addition to X-Ray fluorescence analysis on small spots and large areas using portable (p-XRF) and XRF scanning, respectively. The palette for these three watercolor drawings includes lead white, bone black, vermilion, yellow ochre, chrome yellow, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and synthetic alizarin and carmine lakes. Microfade testing (MFT) was performed on the paper support and spots with each identified pigment, and the data acquired was evaluated both for color change (ΔE00) and rate of color change (\$\${\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}partial {\textbackslash}Delta \{E\}\_\{00\}\}\{{\textbackslash}partial t\}\$\$). Together these techniques inform the future display and loan of these and similarly fugitive watercolors in Cézanne’s oeuvre.},

For this reason, focusing the light on the object’s surface is difficult and the precision of the colour change measurement is hampered. In this study, an improved test methodology was developed to overcome the difficulties by analysing single yarns. The methodology consists in flattening the yarn between glass microscope slides tightly held together by means of 4 strong paired neodymium magnets. The results show that the newly-developed sample preparation together with the required instrumental adjustment allow to significantly reduce the standard deviation and variation coefficient which often characterize microfading measurements of textiles. The methodology for sample preparation is evaluated and had been applied to samples from the Reformation Tapestry dating to 1667 from the collection of the Museum Europäischer Kulturen (Museum of European Cultures) in Berlin.},

Results are reported on four different black paint coatings on a metallic backing. The values obtained for thermal diffusivity are comparable to those reported in the literature following other techniques. Measurements have also been carried out on paint coatings over backings that are good as well as poor thermal conductors.

The microscope light source can be adjusted on two axes allowing for a hemisphere of possible illumination directions. The synthesis of multiple illumination angles allows for the calculation of surface normal vectors, similar to phase gradients, and axial optical sectioning. The extraction of spectral reflectance images with high spatial resolutions from these data is demonstrated through the analysis of a replica cross-section, created from known painting reference materials, as well as a sample extracted from a painting by Pablo Picasso entitled La Miséreuse accroupie (1902). These case studies show the rich microscale molecular information that may be obtained using this microscope and how the instrument overcomes challenges for spectral analysis commonly encountered on works of art with complex matrices composed of both inorganic minerals and organic lakes.},

The first part of this paper presents a brightness measurement procedure based on roughness measurements by confocal microscopy and scattering theory. The resolution of the proposed method allows the separation of as many brightness levels as the eye can detect. This method links the brightness level of surfaces to their microroughness and so provides industry with essential information for the management of the fabrication process in order to obtain the desired final aspect. In a second part, the scattering diagrams of surfaces are computed from microroughness parameters. Computed waviness images are compared with real waviness images.

	abstract = {Optical reflectance probes are often used as tools to obtain optical spectra from superficial tissues and subsequently determine optical and physiological properties associated with early stage cancer. These probes, when placed directly on the tissue, are known to cause significant pressure-dependent changes in local optical properties. To address this, we fit the probe with an optical device that images the illumination and collection fibers onto the tissue surface, eliminating the influence of contact probe pressure on the sampling area. The noncontact probe addition addresses new optical conditions that may affect its performance such as tissue surface contour, and specular reflections by implementing an autofocusing mechanism and cross polarization. Extracted optical properties of tissue simulating phantoms yield errors of 3.46\% in reduced scattering and 8.62\% in absorbance. Autofocusing has extended the depth of field from 4 mm to throughout the 12 mm range of autofocus travel, while cross polarization has removed the incidence angle dependent specular reflection component from the collected signal.},

	abstract = {The light fading of transparent glazes is described from two perspectives: first in terms of the colorant loss from photochemical reaction, then in terms of the color changes that result from that colorant loss. The authors postulate that if the rate of colorant loss depends only on the amount of light absorbed at the photochemically active wavelengths, then the results of light exposure of dark and pale glazes should be very different. The loss of colorant in highly absorbing glazes should be constant with exposure, but only minor spectral changes that cause slight hue and chroma changes are produced. In paler glazes that absorb less light, colorant loss from light exposure should be slower than for dark glazes, and it should also become progressively slower as colorant is lost. Despite this slower colorant loss in pale glazes, large spectral changes result, giving rise to the large chroma losses and value increases that are the changes normally associated with fading paints. The general trends predicted by this simple model were observed in fading experiments of Pigment Red 66 glazes. Although some discrepancies from the idealized fading behavior were observed, these trends are suggested as a starting point for identifying glaze applications that may be at high risk of light-induced damage and may thus warrant special care or condition monitoring.},

The photofading rate curves of madder and weld fixed on cotton correspond to type II fading rate curves described by Giles. These results are in concordance with those of Cox-Crews. The woad presents a type III fading rate curve, similar to the indigo fading rate curve presented by Cox-Crews. A poor light fastness of the three natural dyes in comparison with synthetic ones is established beyond question. Nevertheless, the use of some additives can improve this default of natural dyes. In all the cases, the use of UV absorbers or antioxidants improved the light fastness of dyed fabrics. The most effectives were the vitamin C and the gallic acid.},

	abstract = {An ongoing concern of conservators when restoring paintings and polychrome objects is the possibility of irreversible damage to the original paint layers. This is the case when removal and replacement of aged varnishes is being considered. Although much work has been conducted to determine the effect of the removal of a varnish on the condition of the (painted) surface, there is still some uncertainty in the conclusions because it has, until recently, been impossible to characterize the original surface under the varnish in situ. A promising solution to this problem is the use of white light confocal profilometry. An initial study has been conducted using this technique to measure the roughness of pencil lines and oil paint under a varnish. Measurements were made on areas up to several mm$^{\textrm{2}}$ in size, at lateral resolutions down to 1 \&mu;m, and vertical (roughness) resolutions of 0.1-0.3 \&mu;m. It was found that the surface roughness of surfaces under relatively thick varnishes can be measured at relatively low magnification (20x). For thin varnish layers typical of paintings, higher magnifications are required. White light confocal profilometry has thus been shown to be a useful tool for \textit{in situ} studies of the (sub)surface properties of (painted) objects.},

In addition, such planning decisions are almost always concerned with non-monetary values that need to be incorporated into assessment procedures if the total value of alternative strategies is to be estimated. In this paper, we put forward and estimate models to address both of these issues within a choice-modelling framework. The method is developed in the context of conservation of a particular class of cultural heritage, namely major historic buildings in a city or country. We report results from a discrete choice experiment to assess public preferences in which the choices are alternative conservation programs and the attributes are dimensions of the programs’ cultural and economic value. The model is estimated from survey data using several flexible econometric specifications. We show that the methods developed can be used to obtain robust estimates of the economic value of this category of buildings. We also find a significant contribution of all aspects of cultural value to the formation of conservation preferences and the public’s willingness to pay.},

	abstract = {Digital surveying tools provide a highly accurate geometric representation of cultural heritage sites in the form of point cloud data. With the recent advances in interoperability between point cloud data and Building Information Modelling (BIM), digital heritage researchers have introduced the Heritage/Historic Information Modelling (HBIM) notion to the field. As heritage data require safeguarding strategies to ensure their sustainability, the process is closely tied to conservation actions in the architectural conservation field. Focusing on the intersection of the ongoing trends in HBIM research and the global needs for heritage conservation actions, this paper tackles methodological pipelines for the data-driven management of archaeological heritage places. It illustrates how HBIM discourse could be beneficial for easing value-based decision-making in the conservation process. It introduces digital data-driven conservation actions by implementing a novel methodology for ancient building remains in Erythrae archaeological site (Turkey). The research ranges from a) surveying the in-situ remains and surrounding stones of the Heroon remains with digital photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning to b) designing a database system for building archaeology. The workflow offers high geometric fidelity and management of non-geometric heritage data by testing out the suitability and feasibility for the study of material culture and the physical assessment of archaeological building remains. This methodology is a fully data-enriched NURBS-based (non-uniform rational basis spline) three-dimensional (3D) model—which is integrated and operational in the BIM environment— for the holistic conservation process. Using a state-of-the-art digital heritage approach can be applied from raw data (initial stages) to decision-making about an archaeological heritage site (final stages). In conclusion, the paper offers a method for data-driven conservation actions, and given its methodological framework, it lends itself particularly well to HBIM-related solutions for building archaeology.},

	abstract = {Organic colourants have important applications in many fields. Their photostability is an important characteristic. Several methods to study photodegradation were compared in this work. Eosin Y (C.I. Generic name: Acid Red 87, EY) and crystal violet (C.I. Generic Name: Basic Violet 3, CV) were used as test compounds, both in solution and dyed on silk. Commonly applied methods were included, viz. Xenotest, Microfading-Tester, and light-box (Spectrolinker) experiments. A novel method was based on a liquid-core-waveguide (LCW) cell. After photodegradation on textile, extraction was performed using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The degraded solutions and extracts were analysed with liquid chromatography combined with diode-array detection and mass spectrometry. The degradation products were compared between techniques. Degradation in the LCW cell progressed much faster than in standard tests (Xenotest and Spectrolinker) and could be performed online, without a need for extraction or sample transfer. The degradation of CV in the LCW was comparable to its degradation in standard tests. For EY, there was a clear difference in degradation mechanisms between in-solution and on-textile samples. This could be due to the matrix or to incomplete extraction. Because the light sources used in the different experiments differed in energy and spectral emission, the results could not be quantitatively compared. However, the degradation products formed were shown to be independent of the light source. Therefore, the LCW is an attractive method for rapid and efficient studies into the chemistry of photodegradation.},

	abstract = {In photodegradation a molecule is excited by light, which causes it to degrade. It happens everywhere around us, such as in cultural-heritage, food, and in water-treatment facilities. Studying photodegradation is complex and the current monitoring techniques focus on the degradation of the main component, instead of on the formation of degradation products. In this project, a new way of studying photodegradation was developed. A new light-exposure cell was developed, based on a liquid-core-waveguide principle. One way to use this cell is by coupling it to liquid chromatography (LC) or implement it in two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) as a type of modulator. To optimize the LC separations, retention modelling (RM) can be used, where the chromatographic behaviour is predicted from scanning experiments. In this work, RM was investigated for both LC and 2DLC, as was photodegradation with different (new) light-exposure cells. For RM, new applications in the field were described, after which guidelines for scanning-experiments were formulated. Moreover, RM was applied to stationary-phase-assisted modulation (SPAM), an active modulation technique, to facilitate its optimization in 2DLC. In the second part of the thesis, the new light cell was compared to other, more-established degradation techniques, after which it was implemented in multiple-heart-cut 2DLC. Another LC setup was designed to facilitate the elucidation of photodegradation mechanisms. The thesis ends with the development of an alternative light cell that is more compatible with comprehensive 2DLC.},

In the image analysis of stained histopathology specimens, color unmixing technique, which estimates the dye abundance map, is useful. In this paper, we apply the dye amount estimation method based on color unmixing to Papanicolaou-stained specimen. In the proposed method, we capture the Papanicolaou-stained samples using a multispectral microscope, and then we estimate the amount of dyes from the observation and practically measured the spectral characteristics of the stain. Besides, we construct an application depicting the amount of stain and the bar-graph plot.

Elaboration, understanding, aesthetic aha-insights etc. change the view on the to-be-processed entity\&\#x2014;psychologically interpreted, the entity becomes a part of ourselves. Most methods of measuring art experience are not able to reflect on these dynamics; most of them are just object-based, e.g. correlative approaches of bringing statically assumed object-properties together with simple ratings on these "objects". Here, I will demonstrate the limitations of such approaches, accompanied by the introduction of some simple principles to be followed when art experience is the focus of research. I will then introduce some methods which can assist in unfolding the process character of art experience without interfering too much with the experience as such: For instance, by using posturography, the Continuous Evaluation Procedure (CEP) or automatic facial expression routines. When these techniques are employed with clear rationales in mind, and by deriving concrete hypotheses from a well-grounded theoretical approach, we can come much closer to the rich experience people have when encountering and elaborating art. This will assist us in our human-history-encompassing endeavor of deciphering what and how art is processed and appreciated.},

Many of the results of these experimentations are now available to the scientific domain due to the digitization of large art collections. In this paper we study the depiction of the face throughout history. We used an automated facial detection network to detect a set of 11,659 faces in 15,534 predominately western artworks, from 6 international, digitized art galleries. We analyzed the pose and color of these faces and related those to changes over time and gender differences. We find a number of previously known conventions, such as the convention of depicting the left cheek for females and vice versa for males, as well as unknown conventions, such as the convention of females to be depicted looking slightly down. Our set of faces will be released to the scientific community for further study.},

One example is using colorization techniques when the original color information of the image has been lost or is unavailable. To expand on that, we used Ghent Altarpiece as the study case. One of the panels of this polyptych has been lost, and only an archival photograph exists. Using the state-of-the-art colorization method, we want to digitally restore what has been lost in its original form. In this work, we proposed a pipeline that consists of a colorization transformer (ColTran) trained on the captured patch-based imaging data of the Ghent Altarpiece. We evaluated the proposed pipeline and addressed its strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, we presented planned future steps and improvements for this project.},

	abstract = {We describe the application of convolutional neural network style transfer to the problem of improved visualization of underdrawings and ghost-paintings in fine art oil paintings. Such underdrawings and hidden paintings are typically revealed by x-ray or infrared techniques which yield images that are grayscale, and thus devoid of color and full style information. Past methods for inferring color in underdrawings have been based on physical x-ray uorescence spectral imaging of pigments in ghost-paintings and are thus expensive, time consuming, and require equipment not available in most conservation studios. Our algorithmic methods do not need such expensive physical imaging devices. Our proof-ofconcept system, applied to works by Pablo Picasso and Leonardo, reveal colors and designs that respect the natural segmentation in the ghost-painting. We believe the computed images provide insight into the artist and associated oeuvre not available by other means. Our results strongly suggest that future applications based on larger corpora of paintings for training will display color schemes and designs that even more closely resemble works of the artist. For these reasons refinements to our methods should find wide use in art conservation, connoisseurship, and art analysis.},

	abstract = {Digital imaging techniques have been applied to fine art and cultural heritage for decades. Due to continuing advances in technology and increases in funding, the application of digital imaging and digital reproduction to fine art and cultural heritage has recently exploded. To simplify the discussion of digital fine art, this paper will sub-divide digital imaging into five segments: digital image capture; archiving; conservation; restoration; and reproduction. The Hewlett-Packard Company, Cultural Heritage Imaging and the Rochester Institute of Technology have each been major participants in this digital imaging explosion. The author is familiar with many of the activities of these three institutions. Taken together, their activities form a storyboard of where digital fine art maybe headed. By way of example, the results of specific projects will be discussed. Advances in digital image capture include hyperspectral imaging and reflection transformation imaging and their use at the Worcester Art Museum. A striking innovation in archiving and conservation is demonstrated by the Kyoto International Culture Foundation shrine art conservation project. The rejuvenation simulation of a Seurat painting and the physical restoration of the vault at the Santos Juanes Church demonstrate amazing progress in the field of digital restoration. Finally, the Grand Tour in London is a great illustration of how digital fine art reproduction can involve the public in their cultural heritage. A widespread bibliography is provided.},

To digitally reconstruct its original colors, we use an unprecedented broad scientific analysis and experimental art technological approach, by physically reconstructing oil paints of all pigments used by Van Gogh. We closely match the original paints, and for the first time determine all the optical properties involved. The investigation led to a digital image representing the original colors as good as possible.We found that for the digital color reconstruction it is important to take into account that museum lighting is often relatively dark in order to better preserve paintings. Since this affects the best way of representing the reconstructed colors on the display, we adapted the digital reconstructed image. We also corrected for the technical specifications of the electronic display on which the reconstructions will be displayed in the museum.Based on the reconstruction we conclude that the original colors in the painting used to be much brighter, and agreed much better with Van Gogh\&\#x2019;s own description of the color composition of this painting. We show that unlike the current colors of the painting, the reconstructed colors are consistent with the color theories on which Van Gogh based his work.},

This study follows on from one presented at the previous Archiving conference, expanding on the investigation of colorimetric changes during fading processes.The aim of this study is to illustrate the important issues to consider in the restoration of dye based inkjet images. As such images make their way into museum collections these issues become important when preserving the cultural heritage. This study will also identify where inkjet media and ink technology is not yet up to the task and illustrate the archival properties and colour science of such imagery.The influence of media type, printed colour and ink load are the primary variables explored. The correlation of the fading characteristics with ink coverage and penetration are also included.Whilst this study picks on a single ink set as an example, two very different types of media have been studied in order to illustrate the wide range of results that can be achieved. This will emphasise the importance of the inkjet media in both the fading process and in any restoration envisaged.The characteristics of the cyan, magenta and yellow in this ink set will be shown to be very different. The implications of these differences in the fading of these images will be explored. In addition to pure CMY colours, the effects on RGB combinations will also be considered.Whilst this study concentrates on the light fading of a dye based ink set the results are compared and contrasted with gas fading and light fading of pigmented inks.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic study to demonstrate the above statement does not exist. We present a comparative study to systematically and thoroughly evaluate the performance of demosaicing for low lighting images using two CFAs: the standard Bayer pattern (aka CFA 1.0) and the Kodak CFA 2.0 (RGBW pattern with 50\% white pixels). Using the clean Kodak dataset containing 12 images, we first emulated low lighting images by injecting Poisson noise at two signal-to-noise (SNR) levels: 10 dBs and 20 dBs. We then created CFA 1.0 and CFA 2.0 images for the noisy images. After that, we applied more than 15 conventional and deep learning based demosaicing algorithms to demosaic the CFA patterns. Using both objectives with five performance metrics and subjective visualization, we observe that having more white pixels indeed helps the demosaicing performance in low lighting conditions. This thorough comparative study is our first contribution. With denoising, we observed that the demosaicing performance of both CFAs has been improved by several dBs. This can be considered as our second contribution. Moreover, we noticed that denoising before demosaicing is more effective than denoising after demosaicing. Answering the question of where denoising should be applied is our third contribution. We also noticed that denoising plays a slightly more important role in 10 dBs signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as compared to 20 dBs SNR. Some discussions on the following phenomena are also included: (1) why CFA 2.0 performed better than CFA 1.0; (2) why denoising was more effective before demosaicing than after demosaicing; and (3) why denoising helped more at low SNRs than at high SNRs.},

An InGaAs camera is sensitive to the 900-1700 nm range and provides infrared reflectography (IRR) images. It was previously shown that all these techniques used together allow a tentative identification of pigments laid with gum arabic. While the identification must be confirmed with analytical instruments, this flowchart method allows a fast and low-cost preliminary examination of polychrome works of art. This paper discusses the effects that other binders (egg tempera, linseed oil and fresco) can have on technical photos and on infrared reflectography images of 54 historical pigments. It is shown that only the UVF photos are considerably affected by these binders. The strong fluorescence emission of egg tempera and linseed oil dominate the UVF photos while the binders do not consistently affect the other technical photos, IR, IRF, IRFC and IRR. This study confirmed the validity of this comparative method for the tentative identification of pigments laid with the most common binders used on works of art.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the performance of suprathreshold color-difference tolerances with different visual scales and different perceptual correlates, a psychophysical experiment was carried out by the method of constant stimuli using CRT colors. Five hue circles at three lightness (L*=30, 50, and 70) and chroma (C*ab=10, 20, and 30) levels were selected to ensure that the color-difference tolerances did not exceed the color gamut of the CRT display. Twelve color centers distributed evenly every 30° along each hue circle were assessed by a panel of eight observers, and the corresponding color-difference tolerances were obtained. The hue circle with L*=50 and C*ab=20 was assessed with three different visual scales (ΔV=3.06, 5.92, and 8.87 CIELAB units), which ranged from small to large visual scales, while the remaining hue circles were observed only with the small visual scale. The lightness tolerances had no significant correlation with the hue angles, while chroma and hue tolerances showed considerable hue angle dependences. The color-difference tolerances were linearly proportional to the visual scales but with different slopes. The lightness tolerances with different lightness levels but the same chroma showed the crispening effect to some extent, while the chroma and hue tolerances decreased with the increment of the lightness. For the color-difference tolerances with different chroma levels but the same lightness, there was no correlation between the lightness tolerances and the chroma levels, while the chroma and hue tolerances were nearly linearly proportional to the chroma levels.},

Past studies investigating unique hues commonly used 40 Munsell samples with the same chroma and lightness levels to produce color stimuli, with a hue angle step of 9°. These 40 samples were always simultaneously presented to the observers. Both the larger hue angle step and the simultaneous presentation of the samples may help to reduce the variations. In this study, we reduced the hue angle step to 5° and each stimulus was individually presented to the observer, which resulted in larger inter- and intra-observer variations. The results suggested that the hue angles of the unique hues in both CIECAM02 and CIELAB should be revised, but both CIECAM02 and CIELAB had good hue uniformity at the hue angles of the four unique hues.},

	abstract = {Funori and JunFunori are highly suitable for the consolidation of matte, powdery paint layers. They minimize the risk of optical changes such as the formation of tide lines, darkening, or unintended gloss. Case studies have identified other interesting applications for the two consolidants: as cleaning agents for the removal of water stains and as media for matte retouching.

JunFunori is a new algae-based consolidant. Its traditional Japanese counterpart Funori shows considerable fluctuations in quality. For example, the pH value of 10 different samples was found to vary from 6.2 to 10.4. This inconsistency led to the development of a new purification process that was used to produce JunFunori. Unlike Funori, the first generation of JunFunori (2003–2006) was an almost standardized product. However, recent studies indicate that the quality of JunFunori produced after 2006 fluctuates considerably. Both consolidants are made from red algae. Funori is sold as bleached and dried yellowish-brown mats of algae, which can be soaked in water, warmed, and filtered to produce a yellowish-brown, cloudy adhesive solution. The algae used for JunFunori are not bleached. A gentle extraction and filtering process removes most of the colourants, salts, and proteins. Dissolved in water, the purified product produces a colourless, odourless, and pH-stable consolidant.},

The object of this article is to reformulate the question. The author concentrates on the philosophical aspects of the concept of discipline. He also concentrates on the pedagogical significance of the question. He also asks the question of how the history of conservation can or could be written. He studies four points of view : idealist, positivist, quantitative and archeological – for the same period (1926-1939). He uses both written archival sources as well as non-written sources. His readings have brought him to place the concept of archives at the center of his reflections. This is what brings him to change the sense of the original question by confronting it with the idea of discipline as described by Michel Foucault : a police that regulates the access of subjects to a discourse.},

A card containing eight Blue Wool References2 is exposed simultaneously. Blue Wool References2 3, 6, and 7, are used as controls in determining when to remove test specimens from exposure and rate them. Test specimens are rated by assigning each specimen the number of the Blue Wool Reference that shows the same amount of color change.

1.2 This practice may be used to indicate art materials that will change color within a few months or years in normal indoor exposure and those that will remain unchanged for a period of years. It is not rigorous enough to verify that materials will remain unchanged for more than fifty years in a home or office environment. A major consideration in developing this method was to keep it simple and short enough to be preformed without instrumentation in a comparatively short length of time.

1.3 This practice shall be used to evaluate the lightfastness of art materials only when it is not feasible to use Test Methods D4303.

1.4 This practice is not suitable for evaluating materials with a high oil content such as artists' oil, resin oil or alkyd paints.

In this article, we propose an alternative to the current norm of evaluating research with journal rank. Following a well-defined notion of scientific value, we introduce qualitative processes that can also be quantified and give rise to meaningful and easy-to-use article-level metrics. In our approach, the goal of a scientist is transformed from convincing an editorial board through a vertical process to convincing peers through an horizontal one. We argue that such an evaluation system naturally provides the incentives and logic needed to constantly promote quality, reproducibility, openness and collaboration in science. The system is legally and technically feasible and can gradually lead to the self-organized reappropriation of the scientific process by the scholarly community and its institutions. We propose an implementation of our evaluation system with the platform "the Self-Journals of Science" (www.sjscience.org).},

	title = {Color difference formula and uniform color space modeling and evaluation},
	abstract = {Defining color tolerances numerically continues to be a topic of intense interest in colorimetry. A technique was developed to evaluate formula performance that incorporated visual uncertainty. In this technique, visual uncertainty was represented by randomized equal color-difference ellipsoids or randomized visual color differences. STRESS, a multivariate statistical tool, was employed to quantify these randomized equal color- difference ellipsoids or visual color differences. The STRESS clouds were composed of the STRESS values between the randomized equal color-difference ellipsoids and T50 equal color-difference ellipsoids, or between the randomized visual color differences and T50 visual color differences where T50 represented visually determined tolerances equivalent to an anchor-pair stimulus. These STRESS values clouds were taken as rulers to evaluate whether one color-difference formula over-, under- or well-fitted a specified color-difference dataset, based on an F-test. This technique is a necessary addition to the current deviation evaluation metrics, e.g., PF/3. In follow-on research, a Euclidean color space was developed with the color-difference formula based on IPT color space for supra-threshold color differences. The color-difference formula has similar chromatic modeling to CIE94. A lightness transformation function was applied to model color difference along lightness. A rotation matrix on the chromatic plane was also applied to achieve better characteristics of the color space. A step-wise optimization was performed to achieve better consistency and remove conflicts between different color-difference datasets. The evaluations include STRESS, F-test, hue constancy and equal color-difference ellipsoid shape. It was shown by
the evaluation results that the Euclidean color space could be a potential candidate of a future color model useful for defining industrial color tolerances.},

They support the creation of literate programming documents that combine code, text, and execution results with visualizations and other rich media. The self-documenting aspects and the ability to reproduce results have been touted as significant benefits of notebooks. At the same time, there has been growing criticism that the way in which notebooks are being used leads to unexpected behavior, encourages poor coding practices, and makes it hard to reproduce its results. To better understand good and bad practices used in the development of real notebooks, in prior work we studied 1.4 million notebooks from GitHub. We presented a detailed analysis of their characteristics that impact reproducibility, proposed best practices that can improve the reproducibility, and discussed open challenges that require further research and development. In this paper, we extended the analysis in four different ways to validate the hypothesis uncovered in our original study. First, we separated a group of popular notebooks to check whether notebooks that get more attention have more quality and reproducibility capabilities. Second, we sampled notebooks from the full dataset for an in-depth qualitative analysis of what constitutes the dataset and which features they have. Third, we conducted a more detailed analysis by isolating library dependencies and testing different execution orders. We report how these factors impact the reproducibility rates. Finally, we mined association rules from the notebooks. We discuss patterns we discovered, which provide additional insights into notebook reproducibility. Based on our findings and best practices we proposed, we designed Julynter, a Jupyter Lab extension that identifies potential issues in notebooks and suggests modifications that improve their reproducibility. We evaluate Julynter with a remote user experiment with the goal of assessing Julynter recommendations and usability.},
