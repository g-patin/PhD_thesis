# PhD_thesis

This Github account describes the writing methodology of my PhD dissertation. I wrote my PhD manuscript with Latex on a local machine. Compared to a cloud environment, such as Overleaf, it has pros and cons. A cloud environment is relevant for collaborative projects or when you manuscript needs to be reviewed. But the compilation process has a timeout limit which can be too short to fully compile a PhD thesis. 

Whatever your field of study, I believe that Latex is currently the best choice to write a PhD thesis. The complexity of such a tool may frighten most of us, but its efficiency and the quality of the final documents are far superior to other writing solutions. The aim of this repository is to provide you with a template that you can reuse and adapt according to your needs. 

The following recommendations may prove useful:  

* **Split your thesis**. Don't create a single file which contains the whole of your disseration. In my case, I have a central file, called *main.tex* in which I call for other latex files, such as the abstract, the preface, the various chapters, etc. Use *main.tex* to set-up the environment of the manuscript (packages, layout, commands, etc.) and write the content of the dissertation in seperate files. It will clarify the structure of the writing process and will ease the editing process.

* **Adequate filenaming**. Don't use spaces in your file names, use underscores for each main category and dashes for subcategories.

* **Community-driven**. If an error occurrs when compiling the tex document or if you don't know how to obtain a desired output, it is highly likely that a solution will be available online. Don't hesitate to search through the web or to ask your questions in a forum.

Goodluck !
