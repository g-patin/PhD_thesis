# PhD_thesis

This GitHub repository outlines the writing methodology I employed for my PhD dissertation. The figures and data are not available in this repository but have been stored on a Zenodo repository (https://zenodo.org/record/8216110). Similarly, you can find a pdf version of my dissertation on the digital repository of the University of Amsterdam (https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=ff25ad9b-357e-4881-95c9-d90c277d928a). I composed my doctoral manuscript using LaTeX on a local machine, a choice that comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages in comparison to cloud-based environments like Overleaf. While a cloud environment is particularly benefecial for collaborative projects and manuscript reviews, it does impose a compilation process timeout limit that may be too restrictive for the comprehensive compilation required by a PhD thesis.

Irrespective of your field of study, LaTeX stands out as the optimal tool for crafting a PhD thesis. Although its complexity might initially appear daunting, its efficiency and the exceptional quality of the final documents it produces far surpass other writing solutions. The primary purpose of this repository is to furnish you with a template that you can readily adapt to meet your specific requirements.

To commence, I recommend establishing a dedicated folder structure for your manuscript. Subsequently, you can utilize the main.tex file from this repository as a foundation, customizing it to suit your particular needs, including packages, layout, new commands, folder names, and more. Please note that, due to limitations, the figures associated with each chapter cannot be loaded into the main.tex in this repository. Nonetheless, you can certainly repurpose it for your individual project.

Here are some valuable recommendations to consider:
1. **Divide your thesis**: Avoid consolidating your entire dissertation into a single file. Instead, adopt a modular approach. In my case, I have a central file named main.tex, from which I reference other LaTeX files such as the abstract, preface, individual chapters, and so forth. Use main.tex to configure the manuscript environment (packages, layout, commands, etc.) and compose the dissertation content in separate files. This approach enhances the clarity of the writing process and streamlines editing.
   
2. **File Naming Conventions**: When naming your files, opt for a naming convention that eliminates spaces. Employ underscores to distinguish main categories and dashes for subcategories.
   
3. **Leverage the Community**: If you encounter errors during the LaTeX document compilation or struggle to achieve a specific output, rest assured that online solutions and community support are readily available. Don't hesitate to explore online resources or seek assistance in relevant forums.

Best of luck with your project!
